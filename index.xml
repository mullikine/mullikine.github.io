      <title>Convert hydra to regular bindings</title>

      <guid>https://mullikine.github.io/posts/convert-hydra-to-regular-bindings/</guid>
      <description>The problem: which-key doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with hydra I had made a bunch of hydras which I would simply use as basic menu systems
This is a bit of an anti-pattern.
Hydras should only be used for creating temporary modes.
The solution: create a macro which converts the hydras into regular bindings prerequisites (defun sed (command stdin) &amp;#34;wrapper around sed&amp;#34; (interactive) (setq stdin (str stdin)) (setq command (concat &amp;#34;sed &amp;#39;&amp;#34; (str command) &amp;#34;&amp;#39;&amp;#34;)) (sh-notty command stdin) ) The aim Wrap a defhydra with the convert-hydra-to-sslk macro to turn it into regular keybindings.</description>

      <description>Helm, ivy and completing-read are 3 emacs-lisp alternatives to fzf.
They are all a little different to hack on / configure though.
helm Select from a list There are different ways to select from a list.
(defun fz-must-match (list &amp;amp;optional prompt) (setq prompt (or prompt &amp;#34;:&amp;#34;)) (helm-comp-read prompt list :must-match t)) ;; This is very useful (defun fz-default-return-query (list &amp;amp;optional prompt) (setq prompt (or prompt &amp;#34;:&amp;#34;)) (helm-comp-read prompt list :must-match &amp;#39;confirm)) ;; But I don&amp;#39;t like confirm things (defun fz-default-return-query (list &amp;amp;optional prompt) (setq prompt (or prompt &amp;#34;:&amp;#34;)) (helm-comp-read prompt list :must-match &amp;#39;nil)) Getting the list of options in another window tv takes a string and opens a window with it.</description>

      <description>emacs 27 has an update to emacs&amp;rsquo; tetris mode which makes the glyphs display larger on higher DPI screens.
This script will download that update from git.savannah.gnu.org and display tetris in a distraction free environment for the ultimate productivity.
symlinks If you symlink this script to etetris-vt100 and run that instead, you will get the animated and striking black and white terminal version.
ln -s etetris etetris-vt100 If you symlink this script to etetris-xterm and run that instead, you will get the vivid color terminal version.</description>

      <description>Use Google cache Often Google cache has a full copy of an article.
Check for the existence of the cache for a given URL as some URLs may not be cached.
I had originally used curl for this.

This is not an accurate science. Sometimes the cache is needed and sometimes it is not, but the more information we bring in (such as if the cache exists), the better, as this leads to a more informed decision.</description>

      <description>The GitHub API The GitHub API is useful for many things including running searches on issues, repositories and contributors.
It makes use of pagination and rate limiting.
We like the convenience of curl on the command line and don&amp;rsquo;t wish to learn another tool.
Therefore we make a wrapper script around curl to take care of authentication and pagination.

      <description>What is list-processes? list-processes is an emacs-lisp function which displays daemons running as subprocesses under emacs.
The trouble with list-processes  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t format the command string  Commands with multiline arguments are printed verbatim Arguments are not quoted   This means that commands may flow several lines (as many as it takes to print out the full command).
Also, 90% of the time you can&amp;rsquo;t copy the command and paste in the terminal because individual parameters with spaces are split into separate arguments.</description>

This tutorial is useful to learn to write emacs-lisp macros but is also useful for understanding macros of any language.

      <description>Making tenets with CLQL that do the job of existing linters I started learning Go and CodeLingo / CLQL at the same time, so while I have found it generally easy and straightforward to create these tenets, I feel like I could&amp;rsquo;ve knocked them out even faster if I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to look up answers to questions such as &amp;lsquo;what is an interface in golang?&amp;rsquo;, for example. The process has been intuitive; I think in part to having a good naming convention.</description>

      <description>Read the original article here.           Written by: Kevin R. Stravers &amp;lt;2017-11-17 Fri&amp;gt;    Practical macros in Racket and how to work with them A macro is central in any Lisp and must be mastered in order to master the language. However, Racket is in a state of macro chaos - at least in the official documentation. There&amp;rsquo;s define-syntax-rule, syntax-parse, syntax-case, and so many more.</description>
