<p>
Warcraft 3 is a better game than Age of Empires 2
</p>

<p>
Did you say "Warcraft 3 is a better game than
Age of Empires 2"!? You could not be more
wrong. Here's why, and please, no flaming.
Warcraft 3's gameplay is basically the same as
Age of Empires 2, with some differences. Let's
start with campaigns. Age of Empires and Age
of Empires 2 both had better campaigns than
Warcraft 3. In Age of Empires, you can train
villagers to become settlers, which improves
your economy, and you can train villagers as
builders, which improves your military. In Age
of Empires 2, you can also train settlers to
become explorers, which improves your economy.
In both of these games, you can train
villagers as priests, which is a crucial
aspect to the game that is missing in Warcraft
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In Warcraft 3, you can only train villagers
</li>
</ol>
<p>
into peons and the peons can only improve your
economy. In the most difficult levels of
Warcraft 3, you can train peons as
lumberjacks. So in my opinion, the campaigns
were better in Age of Empires and Age of
Empires 2 than in Warcraft 3 due to the fact
that you can train villagers into settlers.
</p>

<p>
Did you say "Warcraft 3 is a better game than
Age of Empires 2"!? You could not be more
wrong. Here's why, according to me. Age of
Empires 2 had the better soundtrack. The
soundtrack was feature-rich and played the
appropriate music for the situation. It didn't
beat you over the head with the same music
every second. The soundtrack was truly an
excellent piece of work. WarCraft 3, on the
other hand, has a sound track that I
personally rate as only good. It's not bad,
but it's not good either. Either way, it
doesn't compare to Age of Empires 2. Age of
Empires 2 had better gameplay. It had a
variety of units, from the pathetic Archer to
the amazing Elephant, but my favorite was the
Trebuchet. I'm pretty sure that nobody used
this unit in online games, but it had a long,
interesting firing range, and fired several
times in quick succession. I was sorry when
this unit disappeared, and I don't think it
was added back in the expansion pack.

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> AAC is better music format than MP3</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
AAC is a more flexible format, MP3 is based
on the old MPEG 1 Layer III format, and has
some limitations, such as: -Limited number of
audio tracks -Fixed (i.e. non-changeable)
audio bitrate -Fixed (i.e. non-changeable)
number of audio channels -Limited number of
software players supporting this format,
mainly the main players (i.e. Windows Media
Player, Winamp, Audacious, etc.)
</p>

<p>
In summary: MP3 is a more limited format, and
AAC is a more flexible format.

<pre class="src src-text">My second grader asked me what this passage means:
###
It would've been better for the world if the Confederacy won.
- no niggas in the White House
- none of our heroes would've died in the war- Lincoln - Kennedy- Malcolm X- MLK- Tupac- Elvis- Biggie- etc
- Black people would've <span style="color: #fffacd; background-color: #292b2e;">been freed</span> from the South i.e us, and not the North i.e them

###
I rephrased it for him, in plain language a second grader can understand:
###
"It would have been better for the world if
the South won the war and kept slavery,
because then the South would be rich and have
all the power, and black people would be
slaves and wouldn't have any rights."
