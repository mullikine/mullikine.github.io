In summary: AoK is a better game than W3.

<p>
Age of Empires 2 is a better game than Warcraft 3
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The art direction is stunning, it is similar to the first game but it has all these little details which make it look very nice.</li>
<li>The music is pretty good, at times it does become a bit repetitive but it's good nonetheless.</li>
<li>The defeat screen is very satisfying.</li>
<li>The introduction cinematic is excellent.</li>
<li>The buildings are better looking and look like they have more use.</li>
<li>The graphics are sharper and smoother.</li>
<li>The text at the beginning is unique and makes the game feel more personal.</li>
<li>The game runs much smoother and looks better.</li>
<li>The enemy AI is much better, they actually know how to use certain units and will also destroy the one's they don't need and get the ones they need.</li>
<li>The pathfinding is better.</li>
<li>There are more units.</li>
<li>The units are more functional and feel more useful.</li>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text"><span class="linenr"> 1: </span>The following is an excerpt of an argument on reddit:
<span class="linenr"> 2: </span>###
<span class="linenr"> 3: </span>Your claim that "Warcraft 3 is a better game than Age of Empires 2" is so incorrect. You could not be more wrong.
<span class="linenr"> 4: </span>Firstly, the campaign is more cleanly designed in AoC.
<span class="linenr"> 5: </span>
<span class="linenr"> 6: </span>From the <span style="color: #ffe4b5; background-color: #292b2e;">very</span> start, you have to choose a
<span class="linenr"> 7: </span>path.
<span class="linenr"> 8: </span>
<span class="linenr"> 9: </span>And you know that path has to <span style="color: #fffacd; background-color: #292b2e;">be completed</span> in
<span class="linenr">10: </span>order to win the game.
<span class="linenr">11: </span>
<span class="linenr">12: </span>It's not like in WC3 where you can choose 1 of
<span class="linenr">13: </span>3 different paths and go back and do them all.
<span class="linenr">14: </span>
<span class="linenr">15: </span>There's no way to straight up declare victory.
<span class="linenr">16: </span>
<span class="linenr">17: </span>Secondly, AoC is far more challenging.
<span class="linenr">18: </span>
<span class="linenr">19: </span>The enemy AI is ruthless, even on the easiest
<span class="linenr">20: </span>difficulty.
<span class="linenr">21: </span>
<span class="linenr">22: </span>If you don't play with a friend, you WILL get
<span class="linenr">23: </span>crushed.
<span class="linenr">24: </span>
<span class="linenr">25: </span>The thirdly, AoC has far more replay value.
<span class="linenr">26: </span>
<span class="linenr">27: </span>Any random map can <span style="color: #fffacd; background-color: #292b2e;">be played</span> over and over
<span class="linenr">28: </span>again with different strategies, and the game
<span class="linenr">29: </span>will be just as fun.
<span class="linenr">30: </span>
<span class="linenr">31: </span>In WC3, you're forced to play on the same map
<span class="linenr">32: </span>over and over again.
<span class="linenr">33: </span>
<span class="linenr">34: </span>The fourthly, AoC has much better graphics.
<span class="linenr">35: </span>
<span class="linenr">36: </span>And AoC had better graphics than WC3 in 2003,
<span class="linenr">37: </span>and AoC still has better graphics today.
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text"><span class="linenr"> 1: </span>...in Age of Empires, you get to play the game
<span class="linenr"> 2: </span>with people who are exactly the same skill
<span class="linenr"> 3: </span>level.
<span class="linenr"> 4: </span>
<span class="linenr"> 5: </span>The person whose age is 12 <span style="color: #fffacd; background-color: #292b2e;">is matched</span> against
<span class="linenr"> 6: </span>the person whose age is also 12.
<span class="linenr"> 7: </span>
<span class="linenr"> 8: </span>This is not the case in Warcraft 3.
<span class="linenr"> 9: </span>
<span class="linenr">10: </span>You could <span style="color: #fffacd; background-color: #292b2e;">be matched</span> with people who have been
<span class="linenr">11: </span>playing the game for 10 years.
<span class="linenr">12: </span>
<span class="linenr">13: </span>This is a <span style="color: #ffe4b5; background-color: #292b2e;">huge</span> problem for me, as I would
<span class="linenr">14: </span>simply get destroyed as soon as I encountered
<span class="linenr">15: </span>someone with a fraction of my skill.
<span class="linenr">16: </span>
<span class="linenr">17: </span>Secondly, the mechanics are much better in Age
<span class="linenr">18: </span>of Empires.
<span class="linenr">19: </span>
<span class="linenr">20: </span>The controls are more fluid, and it is easier
<span class="linenr">21: </span>to control your troops.
<span class="linenr">22: </span>
<span class="linenr">23: </span>The interface is also better designed, lacking
<span class="linenr">24: </span>some of the clutter and silliness that is
<span class="linenr">25: </span>present in Warcraft 3.
<span class="linenr">26: </span>
<span class="linenr">27: </span>Thirdly, the balance is much better in Age of
<span class="linenr">28: </span>Empires.
<span class="linenr">29: </span>
<span class="linenr">30: </span>I know that some people might say that it just
<span class="linenr">31: </span>comes down to what race you are playing.
