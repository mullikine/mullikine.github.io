      <description>Original article https://www.dnvgl.com/services/hil-testing-concept-explanation--83385  Instead of being connected to the actual equipment on the vessel, the control system is connected to a HIL simulator with sophisticated models of the vessel and its equipment.
This enables systematic and comprehensive testing of control system functionality and failure handling without risk to people, equipment or environment.
Accomplished by Facilitate systematic testing of control system:
 design philosophy, functionality, performance, and failure handling capability, both in normal and off-design operating conditions.</description>

      <description>Original article What Is Hardware-in-the-Loop? - National Instruments  Why HIL &amp;ndash; The problem to be solved Consider testing the electronic components of a new car.
To remain relevant in todayâ€™s market, modern vehicles need to include ADAS, cameras, radar, and more.
Testing these subsystems on the assembled product in desired use cases ensures that testing is performed in the ideal context, but it also incurs significant test overhead and the challenge of testing every scenario.</description>
