      <title>Universal file parser and query tool in emacs</title>

      <guid>https://mullikine.github.io/posts/universal-antlr-parser-in-emacs/</guid>
      <description>Summary I make a way to get a more abstract representation of any type of file or buffer in emacs utilising parsers, antlr4 in particular.
I also want to be able to query the contents of the source code.
I also want to be able to query prose programmatically.
Motivation In the past I have used ctags to get simple lists of source code components such as functions and classes. I would like to have much finer control over queries to source code.</description>

      <description>Glossary 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  expression problem The goal is to define a datatype by cases, where one can add new cases to the datatype and new functions over the datatype, without recompiling existing code, and while retaining static type safety (e.g., no casts).   Adding new languages to Semantic  Original article https://github.com/github/semantic/blob/master/docs/adding-new-languages.md  Adding new languages and syntax requires no changes to existing code.</description>
