      <description>Summary The Thing is a lot like GPT-3 due to it being extremely capable, but limited to the queries you give it.
It&amp;rsquo;s as powerful as your understanding on how to talk to it.
The Thing is a black box computer in the nomes series by Terry Pratchett.
I make reference to the first book in the series Truckers.
This book is freely available on the Internet Archive.
