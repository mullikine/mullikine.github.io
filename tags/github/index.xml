      <description>Here I demonstrate searching through and reading lists of things from the command line.
I ran into some issues with the googlesearch pip module It seems to have been taken down from pip.
I changed my script to use emacs&amp;rsquo; eww browser to scrape the results instead eww is pretty reliable.
Demonstration Please be patient as I bypass the problem above.

Some search results from the demonstration above http://linear.</description>

      <description>The GitHub API The GitHub API is useful for many things including running searches on issues, repositories and contributors.
It makes use of pagination and rate limiting.
We like the convenience of curl on the command line and don&amp;rsquo;t wish to learn another tool.
Therefore we make a wrapper script around curl to take care of authentication and pagination.
Tools used to build the gh-curl script:    Program Purpose     jq wrangling json   yq wrangling yaml   curl making http requests   grep matching PCRE in the URL    The gh-curl script #!</description>
