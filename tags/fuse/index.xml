      <description>Summary I wanted to find a simple way to create FUSE filesystems in Python3. I found that support in Python2 was good and there is a good example, as in this gist (https://gist.github.com/wettenhj/7019100), but it appears that direct bindings in Python3 now exist in the form of a different library pyfuse (see option 2), but the most popular way these days is to build a pyfilesystem2 extension and then mount it with fusefs.</description>
