      <description>Original article Identifying the right meaning of the words using BERT  Glossary Uncased [model] The text has been lowercased before WordPiece tokenization, e.g., John Smith becomes john smith. The Uncased model also strips out any accent markers. Cased [model] The true case and accent markers are preserved. Typically, the Uncased model is better unless you know that case information is important for your task (e.g., Named Entity Recognition or Part-of-Speech tagging).</description>

Empirical evidence points to Kneser-Ney smoothing as the state-of-art for n-gram LMing.</description>

Helpful glossary Multilayer perceptron Feed-Forward Neural Network FFNN Basically, these are multi-level logistic regression classifiers. Many layers of scales are separated by non-linearities. Can be used for as autoencoders. Can be used to train a classifier or extract functions as autoencoders. self-attention intra-attention [attention mechanism] Intuition: Reflects on its own position/context within a greater whole. Relates different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence.</description>

Glossary cross entropy loss (between two probability distributions) (and over the same underlying set of events) Higher loss is bad. Measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. Measures the average number of bits needed to identify an event from the set. Data scrubbing [error correction technique] Uses a background task to periodically inspect main memory or storage for errors, then correct detected errors using redundant data in the form of different checksums or copies of data.</description>

      <description>1906.02715 Visualizing and Measuring the Geometry of BERT
https://pair-code.github.io/interpretability/bert-tree/
https://pair-code.github.io/interpretability/context-atlas/blogpost/
Existing representation: word embeddings Language is made of discrete structures, yet neural networks operate on continuous data: vectors in high-dimensional space.
A successful language-processing network must translate this symbolic information into some kind of geometric representation—but in what form?
Word embeddings provide two well-known examples: distance encodes semantic similarity, while certain directions correspond to polarities (e.g. male vs. female).</description>
