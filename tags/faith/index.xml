      <description>1 2 3 4 5 6 7  Make my feet quick, so that I may tread in the heights of the world. When I am anxious, may I trust in your care and provision. I trust that in all places you will make a way before me. May I turn to you for peace and trust in you so that I can be strong. Help me to be calm and quiet in face of things so great or wonderful and when the time comes, grant me peace knowing that you are in control.</description>

      <description>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  Sorry Lord God for my sin. Please give me your gracious mercy. Thank you for the blessings in my life. Please rescue me from my sin. Please separate the sin from my soul, and put the sin as far from me as you can. Please keep my soul watered with your life and under your protection and care, so that I may live by your will always and I will not perish.</description>
