Please consider me for the position of Search Infrastructure Software Engineer.
Since returning from the software industry to study IR (Information Retieval) in 2018, I have been hunting for a job developing search engines.
I have ancillary experience, such as developing cloud infrastructure and developing search engines, but do not have the experience yet of combining those two skills, though I am very eager to find a job doing just that.</description>
