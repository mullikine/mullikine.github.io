      <description>Interviews Coding Design Systems design Product design Behavioural Focus  5 core values   Be bold. Building great things means taking risks. We have a saying: “The riskiest thing is to take no risks.” In a world that’s changing so quickly, you’re guaranteed to fail if you don’t take any risks.
