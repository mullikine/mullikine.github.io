The Uncased model also strips out any accent markers. Cased [model] The true case and accent markers are preserved. Typically, the Uncased model is better unless you know that case information is important for your task (e.g., Named Entity Recognition or Part-of-Speech tagging).</description>

That is, how to get a computer to learn what is in an image based on example images.
Some of his early work in this area included face detection and face recognition algorithms – similar to the algorithms that now run on all smart phones and social media platforms.</description>

      <description>Genesis 11:7 “&amp;hellip;Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.” If supporting many languages in Babel was not confounding enough, lets support arbitrary interpreters too!  The need to specify a custom interpreter arose when I needed to provide my own interpreter for generating an ASCII graph from a dot script.
Objective Specify an :interpreter and/or :filter command to override the execute behaviour.</description>

glossary cross entropy loss (between two probability distributions) (and over the same underlying set of events) Higher loss is bad. Measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. Measures the average number of bits needed to identify an event from the set. Data scrubbing [error correction technique] Uses a background task to periodically inspect main memory or storage for errors, then correct detected errors using redundant data in the form of different checksums or copies of data.</description>

      <description>Types of scalability https://elastisys.com/2015/09/10/scalability-design-principles/
Performance Parallelism and asynchronism is good.
Amdahl’s Law Performance does not scale perfectly linearly.
Some problems are simply better suited for tackling with a parallel approach.
Speedup of a program using multiple processors in parallel computing is limited by the sequential fraction of the program.
A limit to how much benefit we can get from increasing capacity.
Intended for parallel computing, not distributed systems.
Conclusion Try use components designed with parallelism and asynchronism in mind.</description>

      <description>1906.02715 Visualizing and Measuring the Geometry of BERT
https://pair-code.github.io/interpretability/bert-tree/
https://pair-code.github.io/interpretability/context-atlas/blogpost/
Language is made of discrete structures, yet neural networks operate on continuous data: vectors in high-dimensional space.
A successful language-processing network must translate this symbolic information into some kind of geometric representation—but in what form?
Word embeddings provide two well-known examples: distance encodes semantic similarity, while certain directions correspond to polarities (e.g. male vs. female).
A recent, fascinating discovery points to an entirely new type of representation.</description>

      <description>shackle.el provides a single interface for managing the way windows are displayed in emacs. This means you don&amp;rsquo;t have to dig into plugin code to provide ad-hoc advice to specific functions.
Unfortunately, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide an option to split sensibly, allowing you only to specify exactly how you want windows to be displayed.
For example, it will allow to you specify that all help buffers split to the right with the following rule.</description>

Basic git worktree bindings This is because git manages the set of worktrees.
Magit makes use of this % g (magit-worktree-status)j magit-list-worktreesfind-function magit-list-worktrees  Example

      <description>Buttons in emacs are a little bit of a black box.
This makes it difficult wish to extend or modify a mode that uses buttons: yasnippet, for example.
Here is how to find out what the button does before you click on it.
Get the function This is all you need for most cases.
(defun get-button-action () &amp;#34;Get the action of the button at point&amp;#34; (interactive) (let ((b (button-at (point)))) (if b (button-get b &amp;#39;action)))) Special case: help-mode and yasnippet Applying (get-button-action) in yasnippet very unhelpfully provides this help-button-action.</description>

      <description>The idea is you select a region of text on the screen and the text properties will be searched for URLs.
A new buffer is created with all the list of URLs in the region you selected.
This works on any emacs mode.
This also works with w3m for emacs.
If a browser is used through ansi-term or the like then emacs most likely wont be able to scrape these URLs from the text properties.</description>

      <description>The GitHub API The GitHub API is useful for many things including running searches on issues, repositories and contributors.
It makes use of pagination and rate limiting.
We like the convenience of curl on the command line and don&amp;rsquo;t wish to learn another tool.
Therefore we make a wrapper script around curl to take care of authentication and pagination.
Tools used to build the gh-curl script:    Program Purpose     jq wrangling json   yq wrangling yaml   curl making http requests   grep matching PCRE in the URL    The gh-curl script #!</description>

      <description>What is list-processes? list-processes is an emacs-lisp function which displays daemons running as subprocesses under emacs.
The trouble with list-processes  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t format the command string  Commands with multiline arguments are printed verbatim Arguments are not quoted   This means that commands may flow several lines (as many as it takes to print out the full command).
Also, 90% of the time you can&amp;rsquo;t copy the command and paste in the terminal because individual parameters with spaces are split into separate arguments.</description>

      <description>Use Google cache and curl Often Google cache has a full copy of an article.
We use curl to check the existence of the cache for a given URL as some URLs may not be cached.
This is not an accurate science. Sometimes the cache is needed and sometimes it is not, but the more information we bring in (such as if the cache exists), the better, as this leads to a more informed decision.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial we build a function b which allows you to run shell code within elisp syntax (it looks like emacs lisp).
This tutorial is useful for learning to write emacs-lisp macros but is also useful for understanding macros of any language.
First some prerequisite functions (defmacro shut-up-c (&amp;amp;rest body) &amp;#34;This works for c functions where shut-up does not.&amp;#34; `(let* ((inhibit-message t)) ,@body)) (defun get-dir () &amp;#34;Gets the current working directory.</description>

      <description>It all starts with this emacs plugin (require &amp;#39;biblio-arxiv) We create a bash script We name it arxiv-summary.
Cant name this &amp;lsquo;as&amp;rsquo; because it interferes with pip.
Sometimes packages installed wtih pip need the assembler.
#!/bin/bash export TTY # Collect history of all arxiv-summary invocations ( hs &amp;#34;$(basename &amp;#34;$0&amp;#34;)&amp;#34; &amp;#34;$@&amp;#34; &amp;#34;#&amp;#34; &amp;#34;&amp;lt;==&amp;#34; &amp;#34;$(ps -o comm= $PPID)&amp;#34; 0&amp;lt;/dev/null ) &amp;amp;&amp;gt;/dev/null last_arg=&amp;#34;${@: -1}&amp;#34; url=&amp;#34;$last_arg&amp;#34; set -- &amp;#34;${@:1:$(($#-1))}&amp;#34; # shift last arg # if pl &amp;#34;$url&amp;#34; | grep -q -P &amp;#39;^([a-z-]+/)?</description>

      <description>It all starts with youtube-dl youtube-dl is a YouTube video downloader. You can install it with sudo pip install youtube-dl.

 Examples of useful apps which you can only run one of  eww Perl-REPL dictionary-search calculator   The fix: rename the buffer to tack on a hash after it is created Create the advice function (defun unique-buffer-generic-after-advice (&amp;amp;rest args) &amp;#34;Give the buffer a unique name&amp;#34; (ignore-errors (let* ((hash (short-hash (str (time-to-seconds)))) (new-buffer-name (pcre-replace-string &amp;#34;(\\*?</description>

      <description>Original article Practical macros in Racket and how to work with them  This is a copy of Kevin R. Stravers article above, formatted in org-mode with some minor changes.
Practical macros in Racket and how to work with them A macro is central in any Lisp and must be mastered in order to master the language. However, Racket is in a state of macro chaos - at least in the official documentation.</description>
