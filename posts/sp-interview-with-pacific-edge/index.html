<p>Someone please just tell me if there is a &ldquo;kick-me&rdquo; sign on my back: I&rsquo;m too focused on my work to know when I&rsquo;m being gaslighted.</p>

<p>I thought I&rsquo;d do a quick write-up for record&rsquo;s

<h3 id="cxbladder-included-in-the-latest-nccn-bladder-cancer-guidelines-in-the-usa">Cxbladder included in the latest NCCN Bladder Cancer Guidelines in the USA</h3>

<p>Evaluation of urinary urothelial tumor
markers (Cxbladder by direct reference)
may be considered during surveillance of
high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder
cancer.</p>

<p>The NCCN Bladder Cancer Panel considers
this a category 2B recommendation, which
means there is NCCN consensus that the use
of Cxbladder as a clinical intervention is
appropriate.</p>

<p>This follows on from Cxbladder’s inclusion
in clinical guidelines by several New
Zealand public healthcare providers in the
last year.</p>

<p>To be considered for review and inclusion in
the NCCN guidelines requires an extensive
portfolio of clinical evidence, a track record
of clinical use, and broad adoption by
physicians.</p>

<p>This is an important milestone for Pacific
Edge’s commercial journey in the USA, says
CEO, David Darling, and comes on the back of
10 years of successful clinical evidence and
commercial development.</p>

<p>“Over the preceding years many of our customers
in the USA have been hampered in their
commercial use of Cxbladder while the
Cxbladder technology has not been specifically
included in the guideline recommendations.</p>

<p>Inclusion in the NCCN Bladder Cancer
guidelines is a major commercial milestone for
the Company in the USA and will be of
significant value as we progress our
commercial discussions with our many urologist
customers including the large healthcare
organisations we are targeting.”</p>

De novo
    From scratch.
    From the beginning.

    Sometimes used erronously to mean
    synthetically.

Exogenous
    Originating from outside.

Transgene
    An exogenous gene.

Primer
    **/pcr.swf

    A small segment of DNA or RNA that binds
    in a complementary fashion to the strand
    intended for copy.

    Can be made synthetically de novo or by
    breaking up an original sample of the
    initial strand.

    In PCR, primers are used to determine the
    DNA fragment to be amplified by the PCR
    process.  They enable the attachment of
    the DNA polymerase during extension phase.

    The length of primers is usually not more
    than 30 (usually 18–24) nucleotides, and
    they need to match the beginning and the
    end of the DNA fragment to be amplified.
    They direct replication towards each other
    – the extension of one primer by
    polymerase then becomes the template for
    the other, leading to an exponential
    increase in the target segment.

    It is worth noting that primers are not
    always for DNA synthesis, but can in fact
    be used by viral polymerases, e.g.
    influenza, for RNA synthesis.

DNA polymerase
polymerase (simply)
    An enzyme.

    Promotes the bond formation of the joining
    units that make up the DNA backbone.

PCR
Polymerase Chain Reaction
    Enables researchers to amplify
    extremely small samples of DNA, even one
    molecule, into virtually unlimited
    quantities.

    Now a common laboratory procedure, and
    because of its broad range of
    applications, it is rapidly reaching the
    nonscientific community as well.

    ∙   Paternity testing.  The genes of the
        father can be amplified and compared
        to the child’s DNA for similarities.

    ∙   Compare genetic evidence found at a
        crime scene to that of a suspect’s
        DNA.  Even the smallest amount of DNA
        can act as a witness to the crime
        allowing a greater resolution between
        guilt and innocence.

    PCR is also helping in the isolation of
    genes and the decoding of the human genome
    itself.

    How it works

    Cycle of 3 steps:
        1.  Denaturing
        2.  Annealing
        3.  Extension

        H-bonds reform and the cycle repeats.

    Each cycle doubles the amount of DNA
    present in the sample.

    Each step is conveniently triggered by
    temperature.

    Temperature regulation enables the
    ingredients for all steps to be mixed in
    the same container. All the researchers
    need do is mix up the recipe. The raising
    and lowering of the temperature does the
    rest.

    Denaturing
        H-bonds break.

        The temperature is raised to
        approximately 94°F. The heat breaks
        the hydrogen bonds between the amino
        acids of each strand of DNA’s double
        helix. The helix thus unwinds and
        separates into two strands.

    Annealing
        Primers stick to strand.

        The temperature is lowered to about
        58°F and allows the primers to attach.
        The primers attach to the singular
        strands of the sample by reforming
        hydrogen bonds.

        The primers enable the attachment of
        the DNA polymerase during extension.
        The polymerase must have a segment of
        intact DNA on the complementary strand
        to begin the process of attaching base
        pairs and reforming or copying the
        strand. Since the DNA polymerase can
        only copy in one direction along the
        strand, the primers can be selectively
        chosen to amplify a specific segment
        of DNA or the entire strand.

    Extension
        Polymerase base pairing.

        Polymerase moves down the chain,
        adding base pairs as it goes. It only
        travels in one direction.

        The mixture is warmed to activate the
        polymerase. As mentioned, the
        polymerase attaches to the primer and
        attaches base pairs in a 3’ to 5’
        direction. The terms 3’ and 5’ are in
        reference to the carbons of the sugar
        molecule in the sugar-phosphate
        backbone structure of the DNA strand.
        As the polymerase attaches nucleotides
        to the new strand in complement to the
        mother strand, they form hydrogen
        bonds and reform the original
        structure following the primer
        sequence. The mixture can be reheated
        to continue the cycle as long as there
        are enough primers and nucleotides to
        continue synthesizing new strands.

Annealing
    To recombine (nucleic acid strands) at low
    temperature after separating by heat.

Chaparones  (protein)
    Proteins that help other proteins fold and
    are involved in the folding of many
    proteins in vivo.

Autosome    (chromosome)
    A chromosome other than a sex chromosome.

Autosomal dominant
    If a disease is autosomal dominant, it
    means you only need to get the abnormal
    gene from one parent in order for you to
    inherit the disease.

Autosomal recessive
    If a disease is autosomal dominant, it
    means you only need to get the abnormal
    gene from both parent in order for you to
    inherit the disease.

Convergent evolution    (process)
    The process whereby organisms not closely
    related (not monophyletic), independently
    evolve similar traits as a result of
    having to adapt to similar environments or
    ecological niches.

Homologous
    General
        Having the same relation, relative
        position, or structure.
    Biology (of organs)
        Similar in position, structure, and
        evolutionary origin but not
        necessarily in function.

Non-homologous Isofunctional Enzymes
NISE
    Through convergent evolution, completely
    different protein folds can catalyze an
    identical reaction and therefore would be
    assigned an identical EC number.

    A dicarboxylic acid.

Malonyl-    (group)
    The functional group derived from malonic
    acid.

Family      (category)
Families
    Members have similar [secondary /
    supersecondary / domain] structures even
    though their primary structures may be
    quite different.

Domain      (peptide sequence)
Protein domain
    A conserved part of a given protein
    sequence and structure that can evolve,
    function, and exist independently of the
    rest of the protein chain.

    Because they are independently stable,
    domains can be &#34;swapped&#34; by genetic
    engineering between one protein and
    another to make chimeric proteins.

Transgenesis    (process)
Transgenesic (adj.)
    The process of introducing a transgene
    into a living organism so that the
    organism will exhibit a new property and
    transmit that property to its offspring.

    Placement of a promoter that is activated
    only in certain tissues in front of gene
    to be expressed allows for tissue specific
    expression of proteins in transgenic
    animals.

Fusion proteins
Chimeric proteins
    Proteins created through the joining of
    two or more genes that originally coded
    for separate proteins.

    See &#34;Chimeric DNA&#34;.

Promoter    (DNA sequence)
    A DNA sequence that can recruit
    transcriptional machinery and lead to
    transcription of the downstream DNA
    sequence. The specific sequence of the
    promoter determines the strength of the
    promoter (a strong promoter leads to a
    high rate of transcription initiation).

Expression vector
Expression construct
    Usually a plasmid or virus designed for
    protein expression in cells.  The vector
    is used to introduce a specific gene into
    a target cell, and can commandeer the
    cell&#39;s mechanism for protein synthesis to
    produce the protein encoded by the gene.

Strong promoter
    Ensures maximum transcription from an
    expression vector.

    See &#34;Promoter&#34;.

Molecular cloning

Chimeric DNA
    A subset of rDNA.

    rDNA are usually made of material from two
    different species, like the mythical
    chimera. R-DNA technology uses palindromic
    sequences and leads to the production of
    sticky and blunt ends.

    See &#34;Recombinant DNA&#34;.
    See &#34;Chimeric protein&#34;.

Recombinant DNA
rDNA
R-DNA
    The general name for taking a piece of one
    DNA and combining it with another strand
    of DNA.

    DNA molecules formed by laboratory methods
    of genetic recombination (such as
    molecular cloning) to bring together
    genetic material from multiple sources,
    creating sequences that would not
    otherwise be found in biological
    organisms.

    See &#34;Chimeric DNA&#34;.

Recombinant protein
    Proteins that can result from the
    expression of recombinant DNA within
    living cells.

    When recombinant DNA encoding a protein is
    introduced into a host organism, the
    recombinant protein is not necessarily
    produced.  Expression of foreign proteins
    requires the use of specialized expression
    vectors and often necessitates significant
    restructure by foreign coding sequence.

CHO cells (host)
Chinese hamster ovary cells
    A cell line derived from the ovary of the
    Chinese hamster, often used in biological
    and medical research and commercially in
    the production of therapeutic proteins.
    They were introduced in the 1960s, are
    grown as a cultured monolayer and require
    the amino acid proline in their culture
    medium.

    Used in studies of genetics, toxicity
    screening, nutrition and gene expression,
    particularly to express recombinant
    proteins. Today, CHO cells are the most
    commonly used mammalian hosts for
    industrial production of recombinant
    protein therapeutics.

Gamma-carboxylation (PTM)
Gamma carboxylation
    PTM of glutamate.
    Creates a binding site for calcium.

    Adds a carboxyl group to the side chain of
    glutamate.

    Makes blood proteins sensitive to calcium.

Gla  ★
γ-carboxyglutamate (conjugate base)
Gamma-carboxy glutamic acid
    Formation:
        A specialised form of PTM
        carboxylation that occurs in some
        blood coagulation proteins.

        This generates a malonyl-type two
        carboxyl Gla side chain structure that
        enables the bidentate chelation of
        divalent metal ions, in particular Ca
        2+.

        The precursor forms of the enzymes
        prothrombin and profactor IX and X are
        modified in this way. Ten to 12 glu
        residues in a localised ~40 amino acid
        sequence within each protein are
        gamma-carboxylated, which, in the
        presence of Ca 2+ enable the proteases
        to associate with platelet surfaces,
        forming protein complexes and
        activating downstream components of
        the blood coagulation cascade. This
        carboxylation PTM has a requirement
        for the dihydro form of

Gla domain
    Long name:
        Vitamin K-dependent
        carboxylation/gamma-carboxyglutamic
        (GLA) domain

Myoglobin
Mb
    **/Mb.jpg

    A monomer.

    Oxygen-binding curve is hyperbolic.

    A hemeprotein found inside myocytes and
    not the blood stream.

    Primary sequence vs Hb globins
        Only slightly related.

    Affinity vs Hemoglobin
        ∘   Myoglobin binds O₂ much more
            tightly than hemoglobin does.
        ∘   Myoglobin is 50% saturated with
            oxygen at 1 torr partial pressure;
            haemoglobin does not reach 50%
            saturation until the pressure of
            oxygen reaches 26 torr.

    Secondary structure vs Hb globins
        ∘   Virtually identical.
        ∘   Largely alpha‐helical

            similar way.
        ∘   One O₂ molecule is bound to each
            protein molecule by a coordinate
            covalent bond to an ferrous in the
            heme group.

Electrochemical potential

Substrate-level phosphorylation
    The synthesis of ATP by the direct
    transfer of phosphate group from a
    substrate (high energy intermediate) to a
    molecule of ADP.

    The high energy intermediate desperately
    wants to unload the phosphate. That&#39;s
    where the energy comes from.

    Occurs in glycosis and the TCA cycle.

Oxidative phorphorylation
    The use of O₂ to oxidise electron carriers
    NADH in order to generate ATP.

    NADH or FADH₂ donates an electron which is
    used to create a proton gradient which is
    used to phosphorylate ADP.

    This occurs in the electron transport
    chain.

Dephosphorylation
Phosphorylation (opp.)
    The removal of a phosphate group by
    hydrolysis. It is a reversible PTM that is
    coupled to the addition of phosphate
    groups, or phosphorylation. A highly
    regulated process, dephosphorylation
    activates and deactivates enzymes by
    cleaving phosphoric esters and anhydrides.

    Example:
        ATP → ADP + inorganic phosphate

    Employs a phosphatase.

    The prominent hydrolase subclass used in
    dephosphorylation is phosphatase.

    The reversible
    phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction
    occurs in every physiological process,
    making proper function of protein
    phosphases necessary for organism
    viability. Because protein
    dephosphorylation is a key process
    involved in cell signalling, protein
    phosphatases are implicated in conditions
    such as cardiac disease, diabetes, and
    Alzheimer&#39;s disease.

Phosphatase
Kinase (opp.)
Phosphorylase (opp.)
    Is a type of esterase.

    An enzyme that removes a phosphate group
    from its substrate by hydrolysing
    phosphoric acid monoesters into a
    phosphate ion and a molecule with a free
    hydroxyl group.

    See &#34;dephosphorylation&#34;.

    This action is directly opposite to that
    of phosphorylases and kinases, which
    attach phosphate groups to their
    substrates by using energetic molecules
    like ATP. A common phosphatase in many
    organisms is alkaline phosphatase.

Phosphorylase
Phosphatase (opp.)
    Similar to kinase in that it adds
    phosphate groups to proteins.

Kinase
Phosphatase (opp.)
    Similar to phosphorylase in that it adds
    phosphate groups to proteins.

    A type of enzyme that transfers phosphate
    groups from high-energy donor molecules,
    such as ATP, to specific substrates, a
    process referred to as phosphorylation.

    Catalyses the phosphorylation event ATP →
    ADP.

        Lipid kinase

Riboflavin kinase
2.7.1.26 (EC number)
    Catalyzes:

Lipid kinase
    A type of kinase.

    Phosphorylates lipids in the cell, both on
    the plasma membrane as well as on the
    membranes of the organelles. The addition
    of phosphate groups can change the
    reactivity and localization of the lipid
    and can be used in signal transmission.

Receptors tyrosine kinase
    In 2nd year will learn more about these.

    An enzyme that transfers a phosphate group
    from ATP to a protein in a cell.

    An &#34;on&#34; or &#34;off&#34; switch in many cellular
    functions.

    A subclass of protein kinase.

    Most tyrosine kinases have an associated
    protein tyrosine phosphatase, which
    removes the phosphate group.

    Example:
        Insulin receptor.

    Mediate their activity by causing the
    addition of a phosphate group to
    particular tyrosines on certain proteins
    within a cell.

    When insulin binds, the α and β subunits
    dimerize, which activates the
    autophosphorylation of it&#39;s tyrosines in
    the intracellural space and also initiate
    the phosphorylation of certain target
    proteins which have tyrosine residues.
    Once these target proteins are
    phosphorylated, they can have some sort of
    cellular response.

    See &#34;Autophosphorylation&#34;.
    See &#34;Insulin receptor&#34;.

Insulin receptor
IR
    A tyrosine kinase receptor.
    See &#34;Tyrosine kinase receptors&#34;.

    Basic function; the effect of insulin on
    glucose uptake and metabolism:
        http://goo.gl/pyjd3T?image
            1   Insulin binds to its receptor
                which, in turn,
            2   starts many protein activation
                cascades. These include:
            3   translocation of Glut-4
                transporter to the plasma
                membrane and influx of
                glucose,
            4   glycogen synthesis,
            5   glycolysis, and
            6   fatty acid synthesis.

    The &#34;substrate&#34; proteins that are
    phosphorylated by the Insulin Receptor
    include a protein called &#34;IRS-1&#34; for
    &#34;insulin receptor substrate 1&#34;. IRS-1
    binding and phosphorylation eventually
    leads to an increase in the high affinity
    glucose transporter (Glut4) molecules on
    the outer membrane of insulin-responsive
    tissues, including muscle cells and
    adipose tissue, and therefore to an
    increase in the uptake of glucose from
    blood into these tissues.[citation needed]
    In other words, the glucose transporter
    Glut4 is transported from cellular
    vesicles to the cell surface, where it
    then can mediate the transport of glucose
    into the cell.

    See &#34;Glut-4&#34;.

Insulin

    A lipid-soluble molecule usually
    synthesized by microorganisms to transport
    ions across the lipid bilayer of the cell
    membrane. The two broad classifications of
    ionophores are:
        ∘   Chemical compounds (mobile ion
            carriers) that bind to a
            particular ion, shielding its
            charge from the surrounding
            environment, and thus facilitating
            its crossing of the hydrophobic
            interior of the lipid membrane.
        ∘   Channel formers that introduce a
            hydrophilic pore into the
            membrane, allowing ions to pass
            through while avoiding contact
            with the membrane&#39;s hydrophobic
            interior.

Ion channel
Channel
    Two types:

        Voltage-gated

    http://goo.gl/krnrBG

    ∘   When open, a channel is open to both
        the intracellular and extracellular
        space.
    ∘   Can open and close spontaneously or be
        &#34;gated&#34; (regulated).
    ∘   Rate of transport can approach rate of
        diffusion: 10^7-10^8 molecules/second.
    ∘   Creates a polar pore.
    ∘   Allows the flow of ions. Usually Na+
        K+ Fluoride (F-) Ca+.

        ∙   Shaping action potentials and
            other electrical signals by gating
            the flow of ions across the cell
            membrane.
        ∙   Controlling the flow of ions
            across secretory and epithelial
            cells.

Ion transporter
Transporter
    ∘   Binding induces a conformational
        change. This is the main reason while
        transporters are orders of magnitude
        slower than channers.
    ∘   Transporters are selective in
        comparison to channels.

        This is why transporters act like
        enzymes and therefore have similar
        kinetics.

    APT provides the energy by adding a
    phosphate to the pump in a PTM causing a
    conformational change in the pump.

    See &#34;APT&#34;.

ATPase
    A class of enzymes that catalyze the
    decomposition of ATP into ADP and a free
    phosphate ion.

    energy, which the enzyme (in most cases)
    harnesses to drive other chemical
    reactions that would not otherwise occur.

    cells). They are structurally and
    chemically spherical vesicles containing
    hydrolitic enzymes, which are capable of
    breaking down virtually all kinds of
    biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic
    acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and cellular

Dendrite (non-neuronal)
Dendritic (adj.)
    A branching projection of the cytoplasm of
    a cell. While the term is most commonly
    used to refer to the branching projections
    of neurons, it can also be used to refer
    to features of other types of cells that,
    while having a similar appearance, are
    actually quite distinct structures.

    Non-neuronal cells that have dendrites:
    ∙   dendritic cell
            part of the mammalian immune
            system

Enzyme Commission number
EC number
Enzyme Class
Enzyme Classification (E.C.)
    http://goo.gl/Jp89AL

    A numerical classification scheme for
    enzymes, based on the chemical reactions
    they catalyze. As a system of enzyme
    nomenclature, every EC number is
    associated with a recommended name for the
    respective enzyme.

    Identical EC numbers:
        Strictly speaking, EC numbers do not
        specify enzymes, but enzyme-catalyzed
        reactions.

        If different enzymes (for instance
        from different organisms) catalyze the
        same reaction, then they receive the
        same EC number (e.g. NISE).

    By contrast, UniProt identifiers uniquely
    specify a protein by its amino acid
    sequence.

Cinnamic acid
    http://goo.gl/iymd8B?image

    Inhibits tyrosinase. Why?
        http://goo.gl/qQaFpw

        It is not a monohydroxybenzene so
        can&#39;t inhibit in quite the same way
        that 4-hydroxycinnamic acid can.

        It inhibits tyrosinase strongly, but
        not competatively.

        We can say that it doesn&#39;t compete to
        be hydroxylated in the hydroxylation
        of monohydroxybenzenes (the reaction
        tyrosine catalyses), but it looks so
        similar to the substrate it still has
        an attraction to the enzyme and, as
        such, interferes with and inhibits it.
    ☆   In this ↑ true?

2-hydroxycinnamic acid
Ortho hydroxycinnamic acid
    http://goo.gl/9HluK0?image

    Inhibits tyrosinase?
        No. So Why?

    Inhibits tyrosinase. Why?
        Is a monohydroxybenzene.

    A tyrosinase inhibitor:
        ∵ it is a monohydroxybenzene, similar
        to tyrosinase, what&#39;s called a
        ‘substrate analogue’.

        If it looks enough like tyrosine to

    Catechol is a chemical, but a catechol may
    also be used as the name of a substituent,
    where it represents a 1,2-dihydroxybenzene
    group.

    In the human body, the most abundant
    catecholamines are epinephrine
    (adrenaline), norepinephrine
    (noradrenaline) and dopamine, all of which
    are produced from phenylalanine and
    tyrosine. Release of the hormones
    epinephrine and norepinephrine from the
    adrenal medulla of the adrenal glands is
    part of the fight-or-flight response.

    Tyrosine is also ingested directly from
    dietary protein.  Catecholamine-secreting
    cells use several reactions to convert
    tyrosine serially to L-DOPA and then to
    dopamine. Depending on the cell type,
    dopamine may be further converted to
    norepinephrine or even further converted
    to epinephrine.

    http://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/1.14.18.1
    One of 2 ‘tyrosinases’. The other is
    catechol oxidase.

    Activated upon binding molecular oxygen.

    Active site:
        The two copper atoms within the active
        site of tyrosinase enzymes interact
        with dioxygen to form a highly
        reactive chemical intermediate that
        then oxidizes the substrate. The
        activity of tyrosinase is similar to
        catechol oxidase, a related class of
        copper oxidase. Tyrosinases and
        catechol oxidases are collectively

    Inhibitors:
        A competitive inhibitor might be a
        copper ion chelator, tyrosinase
        substrate analogs, or derivatives of
        L-tyrosine or L-DOPA. On the other
        hand, an uncompetitive inhibitor only
        binds to the tyrosinasesubstrate
        complex.

    It is the rapid polymerization of
    o-quinones to produce black, brown or red
    pigments (polyphenols) that is the cause
    of fruit browning. The amino acid tyrosine
    contains a single phenolic ring that may
    be oxidised by the action of PPOs to form
    o-quinone. Hence, PPOs may also be
    referred to as tyrosinases.

Apoenzyme
Apoproteins
 ★  Enzymes that require a cofactor /
    co-substrate [to be active] but do not
    have one bound are called apoenzymes or
    apoproteins.

Haloenzyme
    An apoenzyme together with its cofactor(s)

    variables are regulated so that internal
    conditions remain stable and relatively
    constant. Examples of homeostasis include
    the regulation of temperature and the

 ★  ∘   Phosphorylation turns many protein
        enzymes on and off, thereby altering
        their function and activity.

    ∘   Glucose is normally phosphorylated as
        soon as it enters the cell.

        Tyr amino acid hydroxyl side chain
        functional group to a much larger
        charged, di-anionic, tetrahedral
        phosphate, which creates possibilities
        for additional ion pairing and
        hydrogen bonding. This induces
  ★     localised protein conformation
        changes, that in some proteins results
        in activation of a catalytic activity
        associated with the phosphorylated
        protein, or alternatively the
        conformational change may enable
        interaction with another protein e.g.
        as part of a signalling pathway.

    Phosphorylation can modulate the

Malaria resistance
    Malaria continues to kill more than a
    million African children annually. Over
    thousands of years, evolutionary pressure
    has selected a variety of haemoglobin
    mutations that confer resistance to severe
    manifestations of the disease. The
    mechanisms by which these mutations exert
    their influence are largely unclear.

    See &#34;HbC&#34;.

    HbC occurs mostly in West Africa, where
    its prevalence in some regions is more
    than 25% and greatly exceeds that of HbS.
    Epidemiological studies have shown
    substantial malaria protection by both the
    AC and CC phenotypes in the Dogon and
    Mossi ethnic populations of Mali and
    Burkina Faso. Although reduced parasite
    proliferation in CC erythrocytes has been
    proposed as a mechanism of protection, P.
    falciparum grows normally in AC
    erythrocytes in vitro. Furthermore, the
    frequent presence of substantial parasite
    densities in malarious AC and CC children
    indicates that a process of protection
    other than reduced proliferation must
    operate in vivo.  P. falciparum parasites
    remodel their host erythrocytes
    extensively, placing PfEMP-1 cytoadherence
    proteins in knob-like protrusions at the
    surface of the host cell membrane. These
    cell-surface modifications enable mature
    parasitized erythrocytes to sequester in
    the microvasculature and avoid clearance
    from the bloodstream by the spleen. The
    adherence properties of parasitized
    erythrocytes can lead to life- threatening
    manifestations of disease—accumulation of
    parasitized erythrocytes in the brain, for
    example, produces the clinical syndrome of
    cerebral malaria7. Because of this link
    between erythrocyte-surface modifications
    and disease, we compared P.
    falciparum-infected AC, CC and AA
    erythrocytes in assays of cytoadherence,
    rosetting and agglutination, three
    phenomena that depend on PfEMP-1
    expression at the host erythrocyte
    surface.

Biconcave

Phenotype
Phenotypic (adj.)
    The composite of an organism&#39;s observable
    characteristics or traits, such as its
    morphology, development, biochemical or
    physiological properties, phenology,
    behavior, and products of behavior (such
    as a bird&#39;s nest).

    Results from the expression of an
    organism&#39;s genes as well as the influence
    of environmental factors and the
    interactions between the two.

    Polymorph:
        When two or more clearly different
        phenotypes exist in the same
        population of a species.

    An iron-containing cyclic compound found

    The important part of heme:
        A ferrous iron held between 4
        Nitrogens.
            Carries an O₂ molecule but does
            not become ionized to Fe³⁺.

            Oxygen does not bind to ‘Ferric’
            heme.

    Consists of an Fe2+ (ferrous) ion
    contained in the centre of a large
    heterocyclic organic ring called a
    porphyrin.

    Attached peripherally are methyl-, vinyl-
    and propionyl- side groups.  There are 15
    possible isomers, or ways of arranging
    these side groups (it might seem as though
    there should be more but many are the same
    turned sideways)...

    BUT the same arrangement is always present
    in human globins, known as protoporphyrin
    IX because it is 9th on the list of
    isomers.

    We rationalize that the purpose of the
    haem-globin combination is to obstruct O₂
    from oxidising Fe²⁺.

Permeability coefficient

Fluid mosaic model
    Lipids move, proteins move.
        See &#34;Sendai virus&#34;.

    The plasma membrane is described to be
    fluid because of its hydrophobic integral
    components such as lipids and membrane
    proteins that move laterally or sideways
    throughout the membrane. That means the
    membrane is not solid, but more like a
    &#39;fluid&#39;.

    The membrane is depicted as mosaic because
    like a mosaic that is made up of many
    different parts the plasma membrane is
    composed of different kinds of
    macromolecules, such as integral proteins,
    peripheral proteins, glycoproteins,
    phospholipids, glycolipids, and in some
    cases cholesterol, lipoproteins.

    According to the model, the plasma
    membrane is a lipid bilayer (interspersed
    with proteins). It is so because of its
    phospholipid component that can fold in
    itself creating a double layer - or
    bilayer - when placed in a polar
    surrounding, like water. This structural
    feature of the membrane is essential to
    its functions, such as cellular transport
    and cell recognition.


        A 16C (16 Carbon) fatty acid.

        Different names for fatty acids with

        e.g. 16C Fatty acid is called
        Palmitate.

    When unsaturated,
        Depending on cis and trans affects the
        melting temperature of the plasma
        membrane.

        When trans,
            A trans configuration means that
            the next two hydrogen atoms are
            bound to opposite sides of the
            double bond.  As a result, they do
            not cause the chain to bend much,
            and their shape is similar to
            straight saturated fatty acids.

        When cis,
            The effect of this is that, in
            restricted environments, such as
            when fatty acids are part of a
            phospholipid in a lipid bilayer,
            or TAG in lipid droplets, cis
            bonds limit the ability of fatty
            acids to be closely packed, and
            therefore could affect the melting
            temperature of the membrane or of
            the fat.

            A cis configuration means that
            adjacent hydrogen atoms are on the
            same side of the double bond. The
            rigidity of the double bond
            freezes its conformation and, in
            the case of the cis isomer, causes
            the chain to bend and restricts
            the conformational freedom of the
            fatty acid. The more double bonds
            the chain has in the cis
            configuration, the less
            flexibility it has. When a chain
            has many cis bonds, it becomes
            quite curved in its most
            accessible conformations. For
            example, oleic acid, with one
            double bond, has a &#34;kink&#34; in it,
            whereas linoleic acid, with two
            double bonds, has a more
            pronounced bend. Alpha-linolenic
            acid, with three double bonds,

    one hydrogen.

Genome
    The genetic material of an organism.

Proteome
    The entire set of proteins expressed by a
    genome, cell, tissue or organism at a
    certain time.

    Diversity
 ★      It is now generally accepted that the
        number of distinct forms of proteins
        in a cell is significantly greater
        than the number of genes encoding
        protein products in the genome.

        Two major mechanisms by which the
        diversity of the proteome may be
        expanded:
        ∙   RNA splicing, (follows mRNA
            synthesis).
        ∙   Covalent PTM (follows protein
            jsynthesis).

        It appears these mechanisms have
        evolved to enable the generation of
        increased complexity and system
        control in biology without the need to
        excessively increase the size of the
        genome.

Thiolate group
RS-

Carbonyl group
C=O
–C(=O)–
    A functional group composed of a carbon
    atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom.

Carboxylate group
COO-
    http://goo.gl/yn1BEc?image
    ∙   A carboxylate is a salt or ester of
        a carboxylic acid.
    ∙   Carboxylate ion is α-COO- (resonance
        stabilized)
    ∙   Carboxylic acids easily dissociate
        into a carboxylate anion and a
        positively charged hydrogen ion
        (proton), much more readily than
        alcohols do (into an alkoxide ion and
        a proton), because the carboxylate ion
        is stabilized by resonance.

Polyprotic acid
Polybasic acid
    Able to donate more than one proton per
    acid molecule.

Monoprotic acid
    Only donate one proton per molecule.

H₂SO₄
Sulfuric acid

Diprotic
    A diprotic acid is an acid such as H₂SO₄
    that contains within its molecular
    structure two hydrogen atoms per molecule
    capable of dissociating (i.e.  ionizable)
    in water. The complete dissociation of
    diprotic acids is of the same form as
    sulfuric acid:

    H₂SO₄ → H⁺(aq) + HSO₄⁻(aq) Ka = 1 × 10³

    HSO₄⁻ → H⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) Ka = 1 × 10⁻²

Acid salt
    A class of salts formed by the partial
    neutralization of diprotic or polyprotic
    acids. Because the parent acid is only
    partially neutralized, one or more
    replaceable hydrogen atoms remain. Typical
    acid salts have one or more alkali
    (alkaline) metal ions as well as one or
    more hydrogen atoms. Well known examples
    are sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃), sodium
    hydrosulfide (NaHS), sodium bisulfate
    (NaHSO₄), monosodium phosphate (NaH₂PO₄),
    and disodium phosphate (Na₂HPO₄). Often
    acid salts are used as buffers.

Delocalized electrons
    Delocalized electrons are contained within
    an orbital that extends over several
    adjacent atoms.

    The delocalization of the electron cloud
    in carboxylate means that either of the
    oxygen atoms is less strongly negatively
    charged; the positively charged proton is
    therefore less strongly attracted back to
    the carboxylate group once it has left.

Conjugated
    A conjugated system is a system of
    connected p-orbitals with delocalized
    electrons in compounds with alternating
    single and multiple bonds, which in
    general may lower the overall energy of
    the molecule and increase stability. Lone
    pairs, radicals or carbenium ions may be
    part of the system. The compound may be
    cyclic, acyclic, linear or mixed.

Aromatic compound
    Aromatic compounds contain an
    aromatic-ring configuration of atoms, such
    as benzene whereas aliphatic compounds do
    not.

    Aromaticity is a chemical property
    describing the way in which a conjugated
    ring of unsaturated bonds, lone pairs, or
    empty orbitals exhibits a stabilization
    stronger than would be expected by the
    stabilization of conjugation alone.

Aliphatic compound
    ∘ Aliphatic is the word for non-aromatic.
    ∘ Compounds composed of carbon and
    hydrogen are divided into two classes:
        ∙ aromatic compounds

    Ionization:

            its proton), the AA becomes its
            conjugate base.
                ∴ AA with R-COO- is actually
                the conjugate base of the AA.

    The biologically important amino acids
    have the amino group attached to the
    carbon atom next door to the -COOH group.

    alpha-amino acids.

Classes of amino acids
Classification

Ferrous
Fe(II)
    An oxidation state of iron.
    Normally, the haem Fe²⁺ is oxygenated
    rather than oxidised. (Oxidizing the Fe
    would make it (III) of ³⁺)

    See &#34;Methaemoglobin&#34;.

Ferric
Fe(III)
    An oxidation state of iron.
    Oxygen does not bind to ‘Ferric’ heme.

Metal-binding AA residues in haemoglobin
    In haemoglobin, bound to iron groups are:
        Aspartate
        Histidine
        Glutamate

    They chelate the iron.

    Haem is the functional region of
    haemoglobin.

    The haem molecule contains a ferrous iron
    held between four nitrogen atoms.

    The ferrous iron can bind one oxygen
    molecule.

    Thus, each molecule of haemoglobin can
    bind four oxygen molecules.

    Another protein that binds zinc may have
    cystein and zync chelating the zinc.

        The number is the location of the
        mutation.
        The 2nd letter is the mutated residue.

Brønsted acid
    Able to lose, or &#34;donate&#34; a proton (the
    hydrogen cation, or H+).

Brønsted base
    A species with the ability to gain, or
    &#34;accept,&#34; a proton.

Lewis acid/base reaction
    ∘ From what I gather, this theory
    definitely models acids at a lower(more
    fundamental) level than brønsted and has
    different applications.

    Yields an adduct containing either a quite
    polar covalent bond or coordination bond.

    It&#39;s also worth noting that the electron&#39;s
    shared in the Lewis acid/base adduct will
    be spin paired [there will be a HOMO-LUMO
    interaction for those that care] where as
    a redox process will occur electron by
    electron from reductant to oxidant.

Lewis adduct
    The product of reacting a lewis acid with
    a lewis base.

Lewis acid
    An acid substance is one which can employ
    an electron lone pair from another
    molecule in completing the stable group of
    one of its own atoms.

    The modern-day definition of Lewis acid,
    as given by IUPAC is a molecular entity
    (and the corresponding chemical species)
    that is an electron-pair acceptor and
    therefore able to react with a Lewis base
    to form a Lewis adduct, by sharing the
    electron pair furnished by the Lewis base.
    This definition is both more general and
    more specific—the electron pair need not
    be a lone pair (it could be the pair of
    electrons in a π bond, for example), but
    the reaction should give an adduct (and
    not just be a displacement reaction).

Lewis base
    Has a filled orbital containing an
    electron pair which is not involved in
    bonding but may form a dative bond with a
    Lewis acid to form a Lewis adduct.

    Any species that donates a pair of
    electrons to a Lewis acid to form a Lewis
    adduct. For example, OH− and NH3 are Lewis
    bases, because they can donate a lone pair
    of electrons.

    Some compounds, such as H2O, are both
    Lewis acids and Lewis bases, because they
    can either accept a pair of electrons or
    donate a pair of electrons, depending upon
    the reaction.

Oxidation/reduction processes
    Result in the transfer of an electron(s)
    from one distinct chemical species to
    another .

Covalent bond
    The two elements combining each provide
    one electron to the shared pair unless it
    is a dative covalent bond.

Dipolar bond
Coordinate bond
Dative covalent bond
    A kind of 2-center, 2-electron covalent
    bond in which the two electrons derive
    from the same atom.

Chelate
    Chelation describes a particular way that
    ions and molecules bind metal ions.
    According to the IUPAC, chelation involves
    the formation or presence of two or more
    separate coordinate bonds between a
    polydentate (multiple bonded) ligand and a
    single central atom. Usually these ligands
    are organic compounds, and are called
    chelants, chelators, chelating agents, or
    sequestering agents.

Ligand
    Pronounced &#34;lygand&#34;.

    An ion or molecule (functional group) that
    binds to a central metal atom to form a
    coordination complex. The bonding between
    metal and ligand generally involves formal
    donation of one or more of the ligand&#39;s
    electron pairs. The nature of metal-ligand
    bonding can range from covalent to ionic.
    Furthermore, the metal-ligand bond order
    can range from one to three. Ligands are
    viewed as Lewis bases, although rare cases
    are known to involve Lewis acidic
    &#34;ligand.&#34;

Denticity
    The number of donor groups in a single
    ligand that bind to a central atom in a
    coordination complex.

Monodentate
Unidentate
    Only one atom in the ligand binds to the
    metal, so the denticity equals one, and
    the ligand is said to be monodentate.

Polydentate
Multidentatentate
    Ligands with more than one bonded atom.

Side-chain
    ∘ Sometimes are ionisable.
    ∘ Contribute to the net charge on a
    protein.

Isoform
    A protein isoform is any of several
    different forms of the same protein.

Translation
    Translation is the process in which
    cellular ribosomes create proteins.

ES
Enzyme-substrate complex
    See &#34;induced-fit model&#34;.

Lock-and-key model
Lock-and-key hypothesis
    It states that the shape of the Active
    Sites of Enzymes are exactly Complementary
    to the shape of the Substrate.

Induced-fit model
Induced-fit hypothesis:
    http://goo.gl/kfIcfp?image
    http://goo.gl/V6MsxM

    Explains how the binding of enzyme and
    substrate leads towards the establishment
    of the transition state.

    The enzyme active site forms a
    complementary shape to the substrate after
    binding.

    The shape of Active Sites are not exactly
    Complementary, but change shape in the
    presence of a specific substrate to become
    Complementary.

    When a substrate molecule collides with an
    enzyme, if its composition is specifically
    correct, the shape of the enzyme&#39;s Active
    Site will change so that the substrate
    fits into it and an Enzyme-Substrate
    Complex can form. The reaction is then
    catalysed and an Enzyme-Product Complex
    forms.

Posttranslational Modification
PTM
Protein covalent modifications
    ∘   Think of as assembly.
    ∘   Any modification that happens after
        translation.

    Two main categories of protein PTM:
        Covalent addition
            The chemical group added:
            ∘   Usually a fragment of a
                co-substrate.
            ∘   Usually electrophilic.
        Covalent hydrolysis
            Catalysed by specific proteolytic
            enzymes.

    After translation, polypeptides are
    modified in various ways to complete their
    structure, designate their location or
    regulate their activity within the cell.
    Post-translational modifications (PTMs)
    are various additions or alterations to
    the chemical structure and are critical
    features of the overall cell biology.

    Types:
        ∙   Polypeptide folding into a
            globular protein with the help of
            chaperone proteins to arrive at
            the lowest energy state.
        ∙   Modifications of the amino acids
            present, such as removal of the
            first methionine residue.
        ∙   Disulfide bridge formation or
            reduction.
        ∙   Protein modifications that
            facilitate binding functions:
                ∙   Glycosylation.
                ∙   Prenylation of proteins
                    for membrane localization.
                ∙   Acetylation of histones to
                    modify DNA-histone
                    interactions.
        ∙   Addition of functional groups that
            regulate protein activity:
            ∙   Phosphorylation
            ∙   Nitrosylation
            ∙   GTP binding

    ∘   PTM is a step in protein biosynthesis.
    ∘   Proteins are created by ribosomes
        translating mRNA into polypeptide
        chains.  These polypeptide chains
        undergo PTM (such as folding, cutting
        and other processes) before becoming
        the mature protein product.
    ∘   Protein PTM provides a way to increase
        the diversity of the cell proteome for
        the evolution of increased complexity
        and control of biology.

    Operations:
        ∙   Cleaving peptides from the zymogen
            (precursor peptide).

            Many proteins and hormones are
            synthesized in the form of their
            precursors - zymogens, proenzymes,
            and prehormones. These proteins
            are cleaved to form their final
            active structures. Insulin, for
            example needs to be cleaved a few
            times and have a couple of
            disulphide bonds made.

        ∙   Attaching new molecules to the
            zymogen (precursor peptide) such
            as:
            ∘   Lipid
            ∘   Glycan
                ∘   N-linked glycosylation
                    ----------------------
                    The attachment of the
                    oligosaccharide known as
                    glycan to a nitrogen atom
                    (amide nitrogen of
                    asparagine (Asn) residue
                    of a protein), in a
                    process called
                    N-glycosylation.
        ∙   Formation of disulfide bridges via
            cystein (folding).

        ∙   The AA it operates on.
        ∙   The fragment of the co-substrate
            that is covalently linked to the
            protein.
        ∙   The biological function generated
            as a result of the PTM.

N-glycosylation
N-linked glycosylation

    a process called .

O-glycosylation
O-linked glycosylation
    Not as common a glycosidic linkage as
    N-glycosylation.

    Occurs post-translationally on serine and
    threonine side chains in the Golgi
    apparatus.

    Besides the different linkage,
    O-glycosylation also differs in the method
    of glycosylation.

    Antibodies are often heavily
    O-glycosylated.

    A small regulatory protein that has been
    found in almost all tissues of eukaryotic

Ubiquitination
    Ubiquitination affects cellular process by
    regulating the degradation of proteins
    (via the proteasome and lysosome),
    coordinating the cellular localisation of
    proteins, activating and inactivating
    proteins, and modulating protein-protein
    interactions.

Molecular Biology
    ∘ Field between genetics and biochemistry.
    ∙ In recent years the term molecular
    biology has been increasingly used by both
    the scientific and medical communities to
    emphasise more the genetic aspects of
    biochemistry, reinforced by the
    developments in gene technology.

Nullomers
    Nullomers are codons that in theory code
    for an amino acid, however in nature there
    is a selective bias against using this
    codon in favor of another, for example
    bacteria prefer to use CGA instead of AGA
    to code for arginine. This creates some
    sequences that do not appear in the
    genome. This characteristic can be taken
    advantage of and used to create new
    selective cancer-fighting drugs and to
    prevent cross-contamination of DNA samples
    from crime-scene investigations.

Functional Group
    Functional groups can be made up of other
    functional groups.

Methyl group
-CH₃
    A methyl group is an alkyl derived from
    methane, containing one carbon atom bonded
    to three hydrogen atoms — CH3.

    Alanine has a methyl group.

Substituent
Side-chain
Group
Branch
Pendand group
    An atom or group of atoms substituted in
    place of a hydrogen atom on the parent
    chain of a hydrocarbon.

    Branches from a parent structure.

    Certain distinctions are made in the
    context of polymer chemistry.
        ∘   In polymers, side chains extend
            from a backbone structure.
        ∘   In proteins, side chains are
            attached to the alpha carbon atoms
            of the amino acid backbone.

Propyl group
-C₃H₇
    A linear three-carbon alkyl substituent
    with chemical formula -C₃H₇. It is the
    substituent form obtained by removing one
    hydrogen atom attached to the terminal
    carbon of propane. A propyl substituent is
    often represented in organic chemistry
    with the symbol Pr (not to be confused
    with the element praseodymium).

    There is an isomeric form of propyl named
    1-methylethyl or isopropyl obtained by
    removing a hydrogen ion (proton) attached
    to the middle carbon of propane.

Isopropyl group
    Isopropyl is a propyl with a group
    attached to the secondary carbon.

    Valine has an isopropyl group.

Methylene group
CH₂
    In chemistry, methylene generally refers
    to a carbon atom bound to two hydrogen
    atoms. It may mean:
        ∙ Methylene (compound) or
        (unsubstituted) carbene
        ∙ :CH2 Methylene group or methylidene,
        a part of a molecule with formula
        =CH2, connected to another atom by a
        double bond, as in
        &#34;methylenecyclopropene&#34;
        ∙ Methylene bridge or methanediyl, -CH
        2-, with the carbon connected to two
        distinct atoms, as in &#34;methylene
        dichloride&#34;

    Leucine is like a Valine with a methylene
    group added.

Thiol/sulfhydryl group
SH
    In organic chemistry, a thiol is an
    organosulfur compound that contains a
    carbon-bonded sulfhydryl (–C–SH or R–SH)
    group (where R represents an alkane,
    alkene, or other carbon-containing group
    of atoms). Thiols are the sulfur analogue
    of alcohols (that is, sulfur takes the
    place of oxygen in the hydroxyl group of
    an alcohol), and the word is a portmanteau
    of &#34;thion&#34; + &#34;alcohol,&#34; with the first
    word deriving from Greek θεῖον (&#34;thion&#34;) =
    &#34;sulfur.&#34; The –SH functional group itself
    is referred to as either a thiol group or
    a sulfhydryl group.

Imidazole
Imidazole ring
(CH)₂N(NH)CH
    Properties:
        ∘   Colourless.
        ∘   Solid.
        ∘   Dissolves in water to give mildly
            alkaline solution.

    An aromatic heterocycle,
    A diazole
    An alkaloid.

    Planar 5-membered ring.

    Histidine has an imidazole group /
    substituent.

Physiological
Physiologic
    Normal. E.g. Physiologic pH is normal pH.

Active site
Functional site
    A small port in an enzyme where substrate
    molecules bind and undergo a chemical
    reaction. This chemical reaction occurs
    when a substrate collides with and slots
    into the active site of an enzyme.

Residues
    Because, when the peptide bond is formed,
    the elements of water are removed, what
    remains is no longer an amino acid. A
    residue is what&#39;s left of the amino acid
    once the bond is formed.

    In biochemistry and molecular biology, a
    residue refers to a specific monomer
    within the polymeric chain of a
    polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid.
    One might say, &#34;This protein consists of
    118 amino acid residues&#34; or &#34;The histidine
    residue is considered to be basic due to
    its imidazole ring.&#34; Note that a residue
    is different from a moiety, which, in the
    above example would be constituted by the
    imidazole ring or &#34;the imidazole moiety&#34;.

    During the process by which monomeric
    building blocks (e.g. amino acids) are
    strung together into a polymeric chain
    (e.g. a protein), some material (typically
    adding up to one molecule of water) is
    discarded from each building block, and
    only a &#34;residue&#34; of the building block
    ends up in the finished product. A residue
    may be one amino acid in a polypeptide.

Active site residues
    The active site is usually found in a 3-D
    groove or pocket of the enzyme, lined with
    amino acid residues (or nucleotides in RNA
    enzymes). These residues are involved in
    recognition of the substrate.

    Residues that directly participate in the
    catalytic reaction mechanism are called
    active site residues.

Protein
    ∙   A chain of amino acids joined
        together, usually with a defined
        biological function, is a protein.
        Typically, much longer than a typical
        peptide.
    ∘   You can classify the proteins by pKa
        value.
    ∙   Large biological molecules, or
        macromolecules, consisting of one or
        more long chains of amino acid
        residues.
    ∙   Buries oily groups on the inside and
        decorate their surfaces with charged
        or polar groups on the outside in
        order to increase their solubility.
            ∘   If all the oily bits were on
            the outside, oil and water don&#39;t
            mix and all the proteins would
            precipitate.

    Elements of structure
        ∙ α-helices
        ∙ β-strands
        ∙ turns
        ∙ random loops and coils
            ∘ Stuff that doesn&#39;t fit in the
            other 3.
            ∘ Just connect them up and call it
            a loop or a coil.

Pancreatitis
    Pancreatic enzymes (especially trypsin)
    that digest food are activated in the
    pancreas instead of the small intestine.

    Caused by inappropriate activation of
    zymogens.

    The stomach and small intestine are
    protected against the actin of the
    activated proteases by mucous.

    Breakdown of the mucosal layer leads to
    ulcers.

    the CFTR gene

    Causes malabsorption.

    Abnormally thick mucous secretions block
    the movement of pancreatic enzymes.

CFTR
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator
    A membrane protein in vertebrates that is
    encoded by the CFTR gene.

    An ABC transporter-class ion channel.

    Conducts chloride and thiocyanate ions
    across epithelial cell membranes.

    Chloride helps determine the composition
    of the pancreatic digestive secretions
    among others.

    Mutations of the CFTR gene affecting
    chloride ion channel function lead to
    dysregulation of epithelial fluid
    transport in the lung, pancreas and other
    organs, resulting in cystic fibrosis.

    See &#34;Cystic Fibrosis&#34;.

Celiac disease
Coeliac disease
    Autoimmune disease of the small intestine
    which disrupts the function of the
    intestinal mucosa.

    Vitamin deficiencies are often noted in
    people with coeliac disease owing to the
    reduced ability of the small intestine to
    properly absorb nutrients from food.

    Caused by a reaction to gliadin, a
    prolamin (gluten protein) found in wheat,
    and similar proteins found in the crops of
    the tribe Triticeae (which includes other
    common grains such as barley and rye).
    Upon exposure to gliadin, and specifically
    to three peptides found in prolamins, the
    enzyme tissue transglutaminase modifies
    the protein, and the immune system
    cross-reacts with the small-bowel tissue,
    causing an inflammatory reaction. That
    leads to a truncating of the villi lining
    the small intestine (called villous
    atrophy). This interferes with the
    absorption of nutrients because the
    intestinal villi are responsible for
    absorption.

    Don&#39;t have the di- and tri-peptidases
    required. Can&#39;t undergo this normal

N-terminus (of a protein)
Terminal amine
    ∘   Almost always protonated.
    ∙   The N-terminus (also known as the
        amino-terminus, NH₂-terminus,
        N-terminal end or amine-terminus)
        refers to the start of a protein or
        polypeptide terminated by an amino
        acid with a free amine group (-NH₂).
    ∙   The convention for writing peptide
        sequences is to put the N-terminus on
        the left and write the sequence from
        N- to C-terminus. When the protein is
        translated from messenger RNA, it is
        created from N-terminus to C-terminus.

Phospholipid bilayer
    The phospholipids are like TAGs but
    instead of having hydrocarbons at each of
    the 3 positions of the glycerol, they have
    only 2. That&#39;s why in phospholipid
    diagrams there are only 2 squiggles from
    each polar head group. At the other
    position there is a phosphate.

    Each lipid consists of:
        ∙ Glycerol backbone
        ∙ 2 Fatty acids
            May be different lengths,
            saturated or unsaturated.
        ∙ Phosphate group
            Sometimes has another polar group
            attached.

    The bilayer lipids are very diverse.
    Different types for different functions
    and organisms.

    Proteins are held in place by:
        ∙   Having non-polar amino acids
            within the membrane.
            ∙   Centrally within the protein.
                Will allow the protein to pop
                out from both sides of the
                membrane.
            ∙   Anchoring domain; like above
                but the majority of the
                protein sits on the surface of
                the membrane.
        ∙   Lipidation PTM. The anchor isn&#39;t
            part of the protein but rather a
            fatty acid which is grouped to the
            protein. It likes sitting in the
            membrane.
        ∘   Some proteins will use more than
            one strategy.
        ∙   Exploit features of the polar
            headgroups to hold proteins at the
            surface. (electrostatic

                acids.
        ∙   Longer &#34;fatty acid&#34;/hydrocarbon
            chains are more rigid because
            there are more non-covalent bonds.
        ∙   Double bonds
            More double bonds means lower
            melting temperature. Creates

    Small stabilizing interactions can add up
    to make an important contribution to the
    overall stability of a conformer.

Van der Waals interactions
Van der Waals force
    Represent the attraction of the nuclei and
    electron clouds between different atoms.

    There is an attractive component due to
    the induction of complementary partial
    charges or dipoles in the electron density
    of adjacent atoms when the electron
    orbitals of two atoms approach to a close
    distance. There is also a strongly
    repulsive component at shorter distances,
    when the electron orbitals of the adjacent
    atoms begin to overlap, commonly called
    steric hindrance.

Hydrogen bond
H bond
    The electromagnetic attractive interaction
    between polar molecules, in which H is
    bound to a highly electronegative atom,
    such as N, O or F. The name hydrogen bond
    is something of a misnomer, as it is not a
    true bond but a particularly strong
    dipole-dipole attraction, and should not
    be confused with a covalent bond.

Pi bond
Aromatic bond
Pi aromatic bond
PI interaction
    Occurs when two aromatic rings (conjugated
    p systems) approach each other with the
    plane of their aromatic rings overlapping,
    with successive p-bonded systems stacked
    like layers in a cake. PI bond stacking
    forces contribute to nucleic acid
    stability at least as much as the hydrogen
    bonds between bases.

Hydrophobic

Non-polarness (made it up)
    See &#34;Hydrophobic forces&#34;.

Hydrophobic forces
    When two nonpolar residues approach each
    other, the surface area exposed to solvent

    ∴   Decreases the affinity of Hb for O₂.
        But doesn&#39;t work on HbF.

        It is the tetrameric shape that allows
        the BPG to bind to the hemoglobin.

    Binds with greater affinity to deoxy-Hb
    than it does to oxy-Hb due to spatial
    changes:
        BPG size ≅ 9Å
        Deoxy-Hb ≅ 11Å
        Oxy-Hb ≅ 5Å

        So it fits better in Deoxy-Hb.

    Fits neatly into the cavity of the
    deoxy-Hb, exploiting the molecular
    symmetry and positive polarity by forming
    salt bridges with lysine and histidine
    residues in the four subunits of

Allosteric protein
 ☆  A protein that has allosteric sites.

Bohr effect
    The mechanism:
        Salt links at the C-terminus of β2
        stabilize the deoxy T form and make a
        large contribution to the pH
        dependence of Hb oxygen binding, known
        as the Bohr Effect. In the making and
        breaking of these interactions, His β
        146 moves a great deal, disrupting the
        salt link (charged H-bond) to Asp β 94
        that is formed in the T state. Since
        His titrates near physiological pH,
        this interaction is quite pH
        sensitive.

        At low pH, when more protons are
        present, the His ring N is more likely
        to be protonated and positive; this
        strengthens its H-bond with Asp 94,
        thus favoring the T state and
        decreasing O2 affinity.

        The pH effect, or Bohr Effect, can be
        considered as allosteric regulation by
        the binding of protons.

    The effect:
        A physiological phenomenon stating
        that hemoglobin&#39;s oxygen binding
        affinity is inversely related both to
        acidity and to the concentration of
        CO₂.

        That is to say, a decrease in blood pH
        which leads to an increase in blood
        CO₂ concentration will result in
        hemoglobin proteins releasing their
        load&#39;s of oxygen.  Conversely, a
        decrease in CO₂ provokes an increase
        in pH, which results in hemoglobin
        picking up more oxygen.  Since CO₂
        reacts with water to form carbonic
        acid, an increase in CO₂ results in a
        decrease in blood pH.

Disulfide bonds
Disulphide bonds
    ∘   Created between 2 cysteins.
    ∘   Antibodies contain serveral important
        disulfides and those are serum
        proteins.
    ∘   Very roughly speaking, if you have a
        protein that&#39;s out in the
        extracellular fluid, they tend to form
        disulfides more than proteins that are
        inside of a cell.
    ∙   Serum proteins tend to have
        disulfides.
    ∘   Most cysteins on the inside of a
        cell are actully in the reduced form
        and they don&#39;t form disulfides (there
        are exceptions to that, but roughly
        speaking).
    ∙   In an oxydising environment, two
        sulfhydryl groups can form a link
        where the two sulfurs end up bonding.
    ∘   In a reducing environment, they can
        break up and become their individual
        cysteins.

    The most important reaction of disulfide
    bonds is their cleavage, which occurs via
    reduction. A variety of reductants can be
    used. In biochemistry, thiols such as
    mercaptoethanol (b-ME) or dithiothreitol
    (DTT) serve as reductants, the thiol
    reagents are used in excess to drive the
    equilibrium to the right:

        RS–SR + 2 HOCH₂CH₂SH
            ⇌
        HOCH₂CH₂S–SCH₂CH₂OH + 2 RSH

    Thiol–disulfide exchange is a chemical
    reaction in which a thiolate group -S−
    attacks a sulfur atom of a disulfide bond
    –S–S–. The original disulfide bond is
    broken, and its other sulfur atom is
    released as a new thiolate, carrying away
    the negative charge. Meanwhile, a new
    disulfide bond forms between the attacking
    thiolate and the original sulfur atom.

    Disulfide bonds in proteins are formed
    between the thiol groups of cysteine
    residues by the process of oxidative
    folding. The other sulfur-containing amino
    acid, methionine, cannot form disulfide
    bonds.

    The disulfide bond stabilizes the folded
    form of a protein in several ways:
    1.  It holds two portions of the protein
        together, biasing the protein towards
        the folded topology. That is, the
        disulfide bond destabilizes the
        unfolded form of the protein by
        lowering its entropy.
    2.  The disulfide bond may form the
        nucleus of a hydrophobic core of the
        folded protein, i.e., local
        hydrophobic residues may condense
        around the disulfide bond and onto
        each other through hydrophobic
        interactions.
    3.  Related to #1 and #2, the disulfide
        bond link two segments of the protein
        chain, the disulfide bond increases
        the effective local concentration of
        protein residues and lowers the
        effective local concentration of water
        molecules. Since water molecules
        attack amide-amide hydrogen bonds and
        break up secondary structure, a
        disulfide bond stabilizes secondary
        structure in its vicinity. For
        example, researchers have identified
        several pairs of peptides that are
        unstructured in isolation, but adopt
        stable secondary and tertiary
        structure upon forming a disulfide
        bond between them.

            endoplasmic reticulum (RER):
            alpha-1 and alpha-2 helices.
            These form peptide chains (known
            as preprocollagen) have
            registration peptides on each end
            and a signal peptide.
        2.  Polypeptide chains are released
            into the lumen of the RER.
        3.  Signal peptides are cleaved inside
            the RER and the chains are now
            known as pro-alpha chains.
        4.  Hydroxylation of lysine and
            proline amino acids occurs inside
            the lumen. This process is
            dependent on ascorbic acid
            (vitamin C) as a cofactor.
        5.  Glycosylation of specific
            hydroxylysine residues occurs.
        6.  Triple ɣ helical structure is
            formed inside the endoplasmic
            reticulum from two alpha-1 chains
            and one alpha-2 chain.
        7.  Procollagen is shipped to the
            Golgi apparatus, where it is
            packaged and secreted by
            exocytosis.
    Outside the cell
        1.  Registration peptides are cleaved
            and tropocollagen is formed by
            procollagen peptidase.
        2.  Multiple tropocollagen molecules
            form collagen fibrils, via
            covalent cross-linking (aldol
            reaction) by lysyl oxidase which
            links hydroxylysine and lysine
            residues.  Multiple collagen
            fibrils form into collagen fibers.
        3.  Collagen may be attached to cell
            membranes via several types of
            protein, including fibronectin and
            integrin.

Phosphodiester bond
    A group of strong covalent bonds between a
    phosphate group and two pentoses over two
    ester bonds.

    Phosphodiester bonds are central to most
    life on Earth, as they make up the
    backbone of the strands of DNA.

    Structurally, a phosphate molecule linking
    consecutive nucleic acids.

Collagen
    The main structural protein of the various
    connective tissues in animals.

    The main component of connective tissue.

Cross-link
    A bond that links one polymer chain to
    another. They can be covalent bonds or
    ionic bonds.

Post-translational modification (PTM)
    ∘ Some amino acids are modified after they
    have been transcribed.
    Examples:
        ∙ Formation of disulfides
            Disulfide bonds are usually formed
            from the oxidation of sulfhydryl
            (–SH) groups, especially in
            biological contexts. The
            transformation is depicted as
            follows:

            2 RSH ⇌ RS–SR + 2 H+ + 2 e−

            The occur between cysteine
            residues in a protein.

            See &#34;Oxidative protein folding&#34;.
        ∙ Phosphorylation
        ∙ Glycosylation
        ∙ Methylation
        ∙ Adenylation
        ∙ Iodination
        ∙ Metal Binding

    Examples:
        •   Proteolytic cleavage of a
            precursor form of the protein.
        •   N-glycosylation.
        •   Addition of lipid.
        •   Formation of disulfide bridges
            (secreted proteins).
        •   Hydroxylation (e.g. collagen).
        •   C-terminal amidation (bioactive
            peptides).
        •   Phosphorylation (e.g. milk
            proteins).

    Modifications of this type are in most
    cases important for generating the correct
    active form of the protein.

Oxidative protein folding
    A process that is responsible for
    the formation of disulfide bonds
    between cysteine residues in
    proteins. The driving force behind
    this process is a redox reaction,
    in which electrons are passed
    between several proteins and
    finally to a terminal electron
    acceptor.

Autophosphorylation
    A type of post-translational modification
    of proteins. It is generally defined as
    the phosphorylation of the kinase by
    itself. In eukaryotes, this process occurs
    by the addition of a phosphate group to
    serine, threonine or tyrosine residues
    within protein kinases, normally to
    regulate the catalytic activity.
    Autophosphorylation may occur when a
    kinases’ own active site catalyzes the
    phosphorylation reaction (cis
    autophosphorylation), or when another
    kinase of the same type provides the
    active site that carries out the chemistry
    (trans autophosphorylation). The latter
    often occurs when kinase molecules
    dimerize. In general, the phosphate groups
    introduced are gamma phosphates from
    nucleoside triphosphates, most commonly
    ATP.

Glycogen
    Multibranched polysaccharide of glucose
    that serves as a form of energy storage in
    animals and fungi.

Glycosylation
    If you add a sugar moiety.
        glycosylate

    e.g.
        Glycosylation of Threonine
            2 sugars (a disaccharide) bind to
            a threonine side chain to form
            ‘disaccharadie threonine’.

    Two types:
        N-glycosylation
            The addition of sugar chains can
            happen at the amide nitrogen on
            the side-chain of the asparagine.
        O-glycosylation
            The addition of sugar chains can
            happen on the hydroxyl oxygen on
            the side-chain of hydroxylysine,
            hydroxyproline, serine, or
            threonine.

Methylation
    If you add a methyl group.
        methylate

Adenylation
    If you add an adenylate. (related
    to the base adenine in DNA)
        adenylate

Iodination
Iodinate (verb)
    Add iodine.

    Example:
        Tyrosine gets iodinated to make
        thyroid hormone.  Thyroxine has
        multiple iodine atoms attached to a
        tyrosine.

Metalloenzymes
    Many enzymes bind metals. They are very
    important. Metalloproteins that aren&#39;t
    even enzymes are also very important. A
    ubiquitous metalloprotein is haemoglobin
    that reversibly binds oxygen for us.

    chain in peptides and proteins. The
    sequence is generally reported from the
    N-terminal end containing free amino group
    to the C-terminal end containing free
    carboxyl group.

    or moieties (functional groups) combine to
    form a larger molecule, together with the
    loss of a small molecule.

Gene expression
    Genes are expressed by being transcribed
    into RNA, and this transcript may then be
    translated into protein.

Torr
    The torr (symbol: Torr) is a traditional
    unit of pressure, now defined as exactly
    1⁄760 of a standard atmosphere. Thus one
    torr is exactly 101325⁄760 pascals (~133.3
    Pa).

    Historically, one torr was intended to be
    the same as one &#34;millimetre of mercury&#34;.
    However, subsequent redefinitions of the
    two units made them slightly different (by
    less than 0.000015%). The torr is not part
    of the International System of Units (SI),
    but it is often combined with the metric
    prefix milli to name one millitorr (mTorr)
    or 0.001 Torr.

Pressure
    Measured in torrs. It is a unit used in
    biochemistry and is much smaller than the
    Atmosphere.

Partial Pressure
    In a mixture of gases, each gas has a
    partial pressure which is the hypothetical
    pressure of that gas if it alone occupied
    the volume of the mixture at the same
    temperature.

    Example:
        O₂ pressure (pO₂ in torrs)

Positive cooperative binding
Increased cooperative binding
Negative cooperative binding (opp.)
Decreased cooperative binding 〃
    See &#34;Cooperativity&#34;.

Cooperativity
Co-operativity
Cooperative binding
    A phenomenon displayed by systems
    involving identical or near-identical
    elements, which act non-independently of
    each other, relative to a hypothetical
    standard non-interacting system in which
    the individual elements are acting
    independently. One manifestation of this
    are enzymes or receptors that have
    multiple binding sites where the affinity
    of the binding sites for a ligand is
    apparently increased (positive
    cooperativity) or decreased (negative
    cooperativity) upon the binding of a
    ligand to a binding site.

    ∴ the affinity of Hb&#39;s 4 binding sites for
    O₂ increases above that of the unbound
    hemoglobin when the first oxygen molecule
    binds due to positive cooperativity.

    In haemoglobin:
        Each globin has R and T states.

        Switching state in one globin unit
        makes all the other globins have that
        state.

        Therefore, the tetramer has overall R
        and T states.

        Thus, in the lungs O₂ uptake favours
        more O₂ uptake, and in the tissues the
        release of O₂ favours the release of
        more O₂ (i.e. the process is
        co-operative).

        The binding of O₂ to the Iron-II heme
        pulls the iron into the plane of the
        porphyrin ring, causing a slight
        conformational shift. The shift
        encourages oxygen to bind to the three
        remaining hemes within hemoglobin
        (thus, oxygen binding is cooperative).

HbA
Adult hemoglobin
    α₂β₂

HbF
Fetal Hemoglobin
    α₂γ₂

    The main oxygen transport protein in the
    human fetus during the last seven months
    of development in the uterus and persists
    in the newborn until roughly 6 months old.

    Able to bind O₂ with greater affinity (1/2
    saturated at lower O partial pressure,
    pO²) than HbF, giving the developing fetus
    better access to oxygen from the mother&#39;s
    bloodstream.

    **/HbF.jpg

    Greater affinity for oxygen:
        Due to a change in a single AA found
        in the BPG &#39;binding pocket&#39; in HbF.

        Specificall, His to Ser.
            BPG:
                (-) charge on its surface.
            His:
                (+) charged.
                Interacts well with BPG.
            Ser:
                Neutrally charged side chain at
                physiological pH.
                Interacts less well.

        This change results in the γ subunit
        has fewer positive charges than the β.

        BPG binding less well to HbF, and as a
        result, oxygen will bind to it with
        higher affinity than adult hemoglobin.

    The P50 value for:
        HbF ≅ ~19 mmHg
        HbA ≅ ~26.8 mmHg

    Due to the P50 values, the &#34;oxygen
    saturation curve&#34;, which plots percent
    saturation vs.  pO2, is left-shifted for
    HbF in comparison to the same curve in
    HbA.

HbS
Sickle cell hemoglobin.
    Cause:
        Single amino acid substitutions on
        surface of haemoglobin A.

 ★      Q6V in the β-globin subunit.
        β6Q→V
        See &#34;Mutation map of hemoglobin&#34;.

        When the oxygen concentration in the
        blood decreases, the defective
        hemoglobin molecule forms long
        crystals inside the red blood cell.
        These crystals cause the red blood
        cells to elongate and assume a
        &#34;sickle&#34; shape. The crystallized
        hemoglobin also damages the cell
        membrane so that the cells become very
        fragile.

HbC
    Hemoglobin providing resistance to
    malaria.

    Cause:
        Q6Y in the β-globin subunit.
        β6Q→Y
        See &#34;Mutation map of haemoglobin&#34;.

    Same position as HbS&#39;s Q6V.

    Mechanism of malaria resistance:
        HbC modifies the quantity and
        distribution of the variant antigen P.
        falciparum erythrocyte membrane
        protein 1 (PfEMP1) on the infected red
        blood cell surface and the modified
        display of malaria surface proteins
        reduces parasite adhesiveness (thereby
        avoiding clearance by the spleen) and
        can reduce the risk of severe disease.

            the surface of the protein while
            the hydrophobic portions of the
            heme are buried among the
            hydrophobic amino acids of the
            protein.

    mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate
    base, or vice versa. Its pH changes very
    little when a small amount of strong acid
    or base is added to it and thus it is used
    to prevent changes in the pH of a
    solution. Buffer solutions are used as a
    means of keeping pH at a nearly constant
    value in a wide variety of chemical
    applications. Many life forms thrive only
    in a relatively small pH range so they
    utilize a buffer solution to maintain a
    constant pH. One example of a buffer
    solution found in nature is blood.

Bicarbonate buffer system
Acid-base homeostasis
    Part of human homeostasis concerning the
    proper balance between acids and bases,
    also called body pH. The body is very
    sensitive to its pH level, so strong
    mechanisms exist to maintain it. Outside
    the acceptable range of pH, proteins are
    denatured and digested, enzymes lose their
    ability to function, and death may occur.

    H₂O+CO₂ ↔ H₂CO₃ ↔ H⁺+HCO₃⁻

    Carbonic anhydrase removes water.

    See diagram.

Carbonic anhydrases
Carbonate dehydratases
    Form a family of enzymes that catalyze the
    rapid interconversion of carbon dioxide
    and water to bicarbonate and protons (or
    vice versa), a reversible reaction that
    occurs relatively slowly in the absence of
    a catalyst. The active site of most
    carbonic anhydrases contains a zinc ion;
    they are therefore classified as
    metalloenzymes.

    One of the functions of the enzyme in
    animals is to interconvert carbon dioxide
    and bicarbonate to maintain acid-base
    balance in blood and other tissues, and to
    help transport carbon dioxide out of
    tissues.

Colloid
    A substance in which microscopically
    dispersed insoluble particles are
    suspended throughout another substance.
    Sometimes the dispersed substance alone is
    called the colloid; the term colloidal
    suspension refers unambiguously to the
    overall mixture (although a narrower sense
    of the word suspension is
    contradistinguished from colloids by
    larger particle size). Unlike a solution,
    whose solute and solvent constitute only
    one phase, a colloid has a dispersed phase
    (the suspended particles) and a continuous
    phase (the medium of suspension). To
    qualify as a colloid, the mixture must be
    one that does not settle or would take a
    very long time to settle appreciably.

Protein classes
    ∙ Globular proteins
    ∙ Fibrous proteins
    ∙ Membrane proteins

Globulins
    A class of proteins with a compact
    spherical shape.

Globular proteins
Spheroproteins
    Members:
        Globins
        Immunoglobulins
        Alpha globulin
        Beta globulin
        Gamma globulin
        Albumins

    Unlike fibrous proteins which only play a
    structural function, globular proteins can
    act as:
        ∙   Enzymes, by catalyzing organic
            reactions taking place in the
            organism in mild conditions and
            with a great specificity.
            Different esterases fulfill this
            role.
        ∙   Messengers, by transmitting
            messages to regulate biological
            processes. This function is done
            by hormones, i.e.  insulin etc.
        ∙   Transporters of other molecules
            through membranes Stocks of amino
            acids.
        ∙   Regulatory roles are also
            performed by globular proteins
            rather than fibrous proteins.
        ∙   Structural proteins, e.g., actin
            and tubulin, which are globular
            and soluble as monomers, but
            polymerize to form long, stiff
            fibers

Molar concentration
    The molar concentration c_i is defined as
    the amount of a constituent n_i (in moles)
    divided by the volume of the mixture V:
        c_i = n_i/V

    The SI unit is mol/m3. However, more
    commonly the unit mol/L (= mol/dm3) is
    used.
        See &#34;Molarity&#34;.

Molarity
mol/L
molar
    M → moles per liter solution

    A solution of concentration 1 mol/L is
    also denoted as &#34;1 molar&#34; (1 M).

    1 mol/L = 1 mol/dm3
            = 1 mol dm−3
            = 1 M
            = 1000 mol/m3.
            = 1 molar
        See &#34;Molar concentration&#34;.

Molality
    m → moles per kilogram solvent

Beer-Lambert Law
    Short for beer&#39;s law and lambert&#39;s law.
    Can be expressed in each of the following
    equations.
        A = ε . c . l
        A = log₁₀(I₀/I)

Beer&#39;s Law
Concentration ∝ light⁻¹
    When a beam of monochromatic light passes
    through an absorbing solution, the
    intensity of light decreases exponentially
    with increasing concentration of the
    absorbing solute.

Lambert&#39;s Law
Pathlength ∝ light⁻¹
    When a beam of monochromatic light passes
    through an absorbing solution, the
    intensity of the transmitted light
    decreases exponentially with increasing
    pathlength through the solution.

Quantitative
    Analysis that is numerical (e.g. measuring
    concentration), rather than qualitative
    (e.g. observing a colour).

Quantative Spectrophotometry
    The concentration of a solute in the
    solution can be determined from the
    absorbance value using a formula based on
    Beer&#39;s Law and Lambert&#39;s Law.

Absorbance
    ∘ No units.
    ∘ Absorbance is ratio.
    Absorbance is sometimes called extinction
    (E) or optical density (OD). If Beer&#39;s and
    Lambert&#39;s laws apply, absorbance is
    directly proportional to the concentration
    (c) of a solution and the pathlength (l)
    of light through a solution.
    ∘ Absorbance is the ratio of light that a
    solution absorbs when a light of a
    specific wavelength is passed through a
    solution.

    A = ε . c . l
        ε is the Molar Absorbance Coefficient
        c is the concentration
        l is the pathlength

    A = log₁₀(I₀/I)

Absorbance Spectrum
    The graph of absorbance versus wavelength
    for a particular compound/solute/molecule.

Analytic
    Investigative.

Analyte
Measurand
Assay target
    The target/measured entity of an analysis.

Assay
    A procedure carried out to determine the
    nature or quantity of a specific
    substance.

    An analytic procedure for qualitatively
    assessing or quantitatively measuring the
    presence or amount or the functional
    activity of an analyte which can be a drug
    or biochemical substance or a cell in an
    organism or organic sample. The assay
    usually aims to measure an intensive
    property of the analyte and express it in
    the relevant measurement unit (e.g.
    molarity, density, functional activity in
    enzyme international units, degree of some
    effect in comparison to a standard, etc.).

Intensive and extensive properties
    ∘   Physical properties of materials and
        systems are often described as
        intensive and extensive properties.
        This classification relates to the
        dependency of the properties upon the
        size or extent of the system or object
        in question.

    Intensive Property:
        A bulk property, meaning that it is a
        physical property of a system that
        does not depend on the system size or
        the amount of material in the system.
        Examples of intensive properties are
        the temperature, refractive index,
        density and the hardness of an object.
        No matter how small a diamond is cut,
        it maintains its intrinsic hardness.

    Extensive Property:
        Additive for independent,
        noninteracting subsystems. The
        property is proportional to the amount
        of material in the system.  For
        example, both the mass and the volume
        of a diamond are directly proportional
        to the amount that is left after
        cutting it from the raw mineral.  Mass
        and volume are extensive properties,
        but hardness is intensive.

Electromagnetic Spectrum
    A continuous range of radiation from gamma
    rays to visible light to radio waves.
    Radiation is measured in wavelength.

Molar Absorbance Coefficient  - ε
Molar Extinction Coefficient  - ε
Molar absorptivity  - ε
    ε is a constant that varies from compound
    to compound.

    It is the absorbance of a 1 M solution at
    a specified wavelength and a standard
    light path of 1 cm.

    It has the units L.mol⁻¹.cm⁻¹.
                         M⁻¹.cm⁻¹.

    Therefore, if the pathlength is 1 cm (such
    as it is in a spectrophotometer), that is
    the pathlength units solved.

Monochromatic Radiation
    Electromagnetic radiation, especially
    visible radiation, of only one frequency
    or wavelength. Completely monochromatic
    radiation cannot be produced, but lasers
    produce radiation within a very narrow
    frequency band. Compare polychromatic
    radiation.

Riboflavin
    Vitamin B₂, part of the essential
    cofactors FMN and FAD.

    An absorbing solute. We used it in the
    spectrophotometry lab.

    An important vitamin that humans cannot
    synthesise, and therefore has to be
    obtained from the diet. In the body it is
    a part of the essential cofactors FMN and
    FAD, which bind to specific enzymes to
    transfer hydrogen in oxidation and
    reduction reactions. The flavin-enzyme
    combination is known as a flavoprotein.

    Has a characteristic absorption spectrum,
    which provides the basis for the
    spectrophotometric assay that you will use
    in this exercise to study the technique of
    spectrophotometry.

Cofactor
    Not a protein, nor an enzyme.

    &#34;Helper molecules&#34; that assist in
    biochemical transformations

    Coenzymes are a subclass.

    ∘   A cofactor is a non-protein chemical
        compound that is required for the
        protein&#39;s biological activity. These
        proteins are commonly enzymes, and
        cofactors can be considered &#34;helper
        molecules&#34; that assist in biochemical
        transformations.
    ∘   Binds to and regulates the activity of
        a protein.
    ∘   Needs to be present in addition to an
        enzyme for a certain reaction to be
        catalysed.
    ∘   Must be present for an enzyme to
        function.
    ∘   A contributing factor.
    ∘   A substance, especially a coenzyme or
        a metal, that must be present for an
        enzyme to function.

Coenzyme
Coenzymes (pl.)
    A subgroup of cofactors.

    A complex organic or metalloorganic
    molecule, in contrast to the one or more
    inorganic ions comprising the regular
    cofactor.

    See &#34;Cofactor&#34;.

NADP+
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
TPN
    A cofactor used in anabolic reactions,
    such as lipid and nucleic acid synthesis,
    which require NADPH as a reducing agent.

    NADPH is the reduced form of NADP+. NADP+
    differs from NAD+ in the presence of an
    additional phosphate group on the 2&#39;
    position of the ribose ring that carries
    the adenine moiety.

Active transport
    Requires an input of energy to move a
    molecule up its concentration gradient.

    Energy may come from the hydrolylsis of
    ATP or the co-transport of another
    molecule down its concentration gradient.

Symport
    A type of co-transport.

    Both molecules move in the same direction.

    One is moving down its concentration
    gradient, the other is moving against its
    concentration gradient.

    The only difference to antiport is the
    direction of flow of one of the molecules.

    See &#34;Co-transport&#34;.

Antiport
    A type of co-transport.

    The two molecules move in opposite
    directions.

    One is moving down its concentration
    gradient, the other is moving against its
    concentration gradient.

    The only difference to symport is the
    direction of flow of one of the molecules.

    See &#34;Co-transport&#34;.

Co-transport
Secondary active transport
    **/co-transport.png

    Two types:
        Symport
        Antiport

    Movement of two molecules by a
    transporter.

    No direct coupling of ATP; instead, the
    electrochemical potential difference
    created by pumping ions out of the cell is
    used.

    ATP is indirectly involved; E.g. needed to
    remove the Na+ that has entered the cell.

NAD
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
    A redox cofactor and coenzyme.

    Ubiquitous.

    A dinucleotide.
        One nucleotide contains an A base and
        the other nicotinamide.

    Two forms:
        NAD+ (oxidized)
        NADH (reduced)

FAD
Flavin adenine dinucleotide
    A redox cofactor involved in several
    important reactions in metabolism. FAD can
    exist in two different redox states, which
    it converts between by accepting or
    donating electrons. The molecule consists
    of a riboflavin moiety (vitamin B2) bound
    to the phosphate group of an ADP molecule.
    The flavin group is bound to ribitol, a
    sugar alcohol, by a carbon-nitrogen bond,
    not a glycosidic bond. Thus, riboflavin is
    not technically a nucleotide; the name
    flavin adenine dinucleotide is a misnomer.

    FAD can be reduced to FADH₂, whereby it
    accepts two hydrogen atoms (a net gain of
    two electrons).
    **/FAD_FADH2_equlibrium.png

    FAD (fully oxidized form, or quinone form)
    accepts two electrons and two protons to
    become FADH₂ (hydroquinone form). FADH₂
    can then be oxidized to the semireduced
    form (semiquinone) FADH by donating one
    electron and one proton. The semiquinone
    is then oxidized once more by losing an
    electron and a proton and is returned to
    the initial quinone form (FAD).

    FAD is an aromatic ring system, whereas
    FADH₂ is not. This means that FADH₂ is
    significantly higher in energy, without
    the stabilization that aromatic structure
    provides. FADH₂ is an energy-carrying
    molecule, because, if it is oxidized, it
    will regain aromaticity and release all
    the energy represented by this
    stabilization.

    The primary biochemical role of FADH₂ in
    eukaryotes is to carry high-energy
    electrons used for oxidative
    phosphorylation. Its hydrogens remain in
    the mitochondrial matrix, whilst FAD is
    tightly bound to a dehydrogenase enzyme
    i.e. the second protein complex in the
    oxidative phosphorylation chain. FAD is a
    prosthetic group in the enzyme complex
    succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) that
    oxidizes succinate to fumarate in the
    eighth step of the citric acid cycle. The
    high-energy electrons from this oxidation
    are stored momentarily by reducing FAD to
    FADH₂. FADH₂ then reverts to FAD, sending
    its two high-energy electrons through the
    electron transport chain; the energy in
    FADH₂ is enough to produce 1.5 equivalents
    of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation.
    Another metabolic source of FADH₂ is beta
    oxidation, where FAD serves as a coenzyme
    to acyl CoA dehydrogenase.

    A flavoprotein is a protein that contains
    a flavin moiety, this may be in the form
    of FAD or FMN (Flavin mononucleotide) .
    There are many flavoproteins besides
    components of the succinate dehydrogenase
    complex, including α-ketoglutarate
    dehydrogenase and a component of the
    pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.

FMN
Flavin mononucleotide
Riboflavin-5′-phosphate
    A biomolecule produced from riboflavin
    (vitamin B2) by the enzyme riboflavin
    kinase and functions as prosthetic group
    of various oxidoreductases including NADH
    dehydrogenase as well as cofactor in
    biological blue-light photo receptors.
    During the catalytic cycle, a reversible
    interconversion of the oxidized (FMN),
    semiquinone (FMNH•) and reduced (FMNH2)
    forms occurs in the various
    oxidoreductases. FMN is a stronger
    oxidizing agent than NAD and is
    particularly useful because it can take
    part in both one- and two-electron
    transfers. In its role as blue-light photo
    receptor, (oxidized) FMN stands out from
    the &#39;conventional&#39; photo receptors as the
    signaling state and not an E/Z
    isomerization.

    It is the principal form in which
    riboflavin is found in cells and tissues.
    It requires more energy to produce, but is
    more soluble than riboflavin.

Spectrophotometry
    The technique of measuring the amount of
    visible and UV light that is absorbed by a
    molecule in solution.

Spectrophotometer
    Components:
        Light source:
            To produce radiation in the
            visible range (400-700 nm) and in
            the UV range (100-400 nm).

        Monochromator:
            A diffraction grating which
            produces a parallel beam of
            monochromatic light from the light
            source. In reality, it produces
            light of a narrow band (5 to 10
            nm) of wavelengths.

        Exit slit:
            Reduces the bandwidth of light
            that reaches the sample.

        Sample compartment:
            The cuvette is placed inside the
            cuvette holder in the light path.

        Detector:
            Measures the amount of light that
            passed through the sample in the
            cuvette and generates a signal
            (current).

        Readout:
            Measuress and amplifies the signal
            generated by the detector and
            displays it as absorbance (A).

Serial dilution
    A serial dilution is the stepwise dilution
    of a substance in solution. Usually the
    dilution factor at each step is constant,
    resulting in a geometric progression of
    the concentration in a logarithmic
    fashion. A ten-fold serial dilution could
    be 1 M, 0.1 M, 0.01 M, 0.001 M... Serial
    dilutions are used to accurately create
    highly diluted solutions as well as
    solutions for experiments resulting in
    concentration curves with a logarithmic
    scale. A tenfold dilution for each step is
    called a logarithmic dilution or
    log-dilution, a 3.16-fold (100.5-fold)
    dilution is called a half-logarithmic
    dilution or half-log dilution, and a
    1.78-fold (100.25-fold) dilution is called
    a quarter-logarithmic dilution or
    quarter-log dilution. Serial dilutions are
    widely used in experimental sciences,
    including biochemistry, pharmacology,
    microbiology, and physics.

Dilution factor
    [initial solution]        total volume
    ------------------  or  ----------------
     [final solution]       volume of sample


    Examples:
        ∙ 1 in 5
        ∙ 5 fold

    2 fold means having 2 elements.

Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC)
    A type of size exclusion chromatography
    (SEC), that separates analytes on the
    basis of size.

    The technique is often used for the
    analysis of polymers.

    Separation occurs via the use of porous
    beads packed in a column.

    The separatiton of molecules (e.g.
    proteins) on the basis of size through a
    type of sieve. The sieve or gel is made
    typically of cross-linked dextrans.

    GPC separates based on the size or
    hydrodynamic volume (radius of gyration)
    of the analytes. This differs from other
    separation techniques which depend upon
    chemical or physical interactions to
    separate analytes.

    Separation occurs via the use of porous
    beads packed in a column (the stationary
    phase). The smaller analytes can enter the
    pores more easily and therefore spend more
    time in these pores, increasing their
    retention time. Conversely, larger
    analytes spend little if any time in the
    pores and are eluted quickly. All columns
    have a range of molecular weights that can
    be separated.

Elution
    In analytical and organic chemistry,
    elution is the process of extracting one
    material from another by washing with a
    solvent; as in washing of loaded
    ion-exchange resins to remove captured
    ions.

Retention
    The continued possession, use, or control
    of something.

Retention time
    In gel permeation chromatography, the
    amount of time analytes take to pass
    through the column.

Hydrodynamic Radius
    The theoretical hydrodynamic radius R_{\rm
    hyd} arises in the study of the dynamic
    properties of polymers moving in a
    solvent. It is often similar in magnitude
    to the radius of gyration.

Aerobic
    Requiring air.

Globin
Globin chain
    Different types:
        HbF has
            2 × Alpha (α) chains
            2 × Gamma (γ) chains
        HbA has:
            2 × Alpha (α) chains
            2 × Beta (β) chains
        Mb has 1

    Along with a haem, an α/β  globin chain
    makes a haemoglobin subunit.

    Different types of globin chains differ in
    amino acid sequence but have the same
    characteristic shape.

    R and T states in hemoglobin:
        Only hemoglobin globins have R and T
        states.

Invertebrates
    Animal species that do not possess or
    develop a vertebral column, derived from
    the notochord. Familiar examples of
    invertebrates include insects, worms,
    clams, crabs, octopuses, snails, and
    starfish

Sequester
    Isolate or hide away.

Analogous
    Comparable in certain respects, typically
    in a way which makes clearer the nature of
    the things compared.

Dextran
    Dextran is a complex, branched glucan
    composed of chains of varying lengths. It
    is used medicinally as an antithrombotic,
    to reduce blood viscosity, and as a volume
    expander in hypovolaemia.

    Long chains (polymers) of sugar molecules.

Emollient
Moisturiser
    Complex mixtures of chemical agents
    specially designed to make the external
    layers of the skin (epidermis) softer and
    more pliable. They increase the skin&#39;s
    hydration (water content) by reducing
    evaporation.

Dithionite
    The dithionite anion ([S₂O₄]²⁻), is an
    oxoanion of sulfur formally derived from
    dithionous acid, H₂S₂O₄

Sodium dithionite  (used in exercise 2)
Sodium hydrosulfite
    A white crystalline powder with a weak
    sulfurous odor. It is the sodium salt of
    dithionous acid. Although it is stable
    under most conditions, it will decompose
    in hot water and in acid solutions.

    Reacts with oxygen to form sodium
    sulphite. Therefore, it must be made
    fresh for Exercise 2.

Sodium sulfite
Sodium sulphite
    A soluble sodium salt of sulfurous acid
    (sulfite) with the chemical formula
    Na2SO3.

Dithionate (not concerned with this)
    The dithionate (or metabisulfate) anion,
    S₂O₆²⁻, is a sulfur oxoanion derived from
    dithionic acid, H₂S₂O₆.

Substrate
    A molecule, in the context of a chemical
    reaction, is only considered to be a
    substrate if it&#39;s converted to a product.
    A molecule that is transported by an ion
    transporter protein may also considered a
    substrate in an analogy to enzymes.

    A molecule upon which an enzyme acts.
    Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions
    involving the substrate(s). In the case of
    a single substrate, the substrate bonds
    with the enzyme active site, and an
    enzyme-substrate complex is formed. The
    substrate is transformed into one or more
    products, which are then released from the
    active site. The active site is now free
    to accept another substrate molecule.

    Competition
        http://goo.gl/UBqGsU
        If two enzymes, in different pathways,
        compete for the same substrate, then
        knowing the values of Km and Vmax for
        both enzymes permits prediction of the
        metabolic fate of the substrate and
        the relative amount that will flow
        through each pathway under various
        conditions.

        See &#34;K_M&#34;.

Protease
    For the digestion of protein.

Lypase
    For the digestion of fats.

Amylase
    For the digestion of carbohydrates.
    Breaks down the bonds holding
    carbohydrates together.

Ribosome
    The ribosome (from ribonucleic acid and
    the Greek soma, meaning &#34;body&#34;) is a large
    and complex molecular machine, found
    within all living cells, that serves as
    the primary site of biological protein
    synthesis (translation). Ribosomes link
    amino acids together in the order
    specified by messenger RNA (mRNA)
    molecules. Ribosomes consist of two major
    components — the small ribosomal subunit
    which reads the RNA, and the large subunit
    which joins amino acids to form a
    polypeptide chain. Each subunit is
    composed of one or more ribosomal RNA
    (rRNA) molecules and a variety of
    proteins. The ribosomes and associated
    molecules are also known as the
    translational apparatus.

Signal sequence
    In animal cells, many proteins are
    synthesised by ribosomes on the rough
    endoplasmic reticulum and are normally
    transferred into the lumen of the
    endoplasmic reticulum. The sorting and
    transport of proteins to other locations
    in the cell is controlled by various
    signal sequences (short amino acid
    sequences) that are part of the protein
    sequence. The signal sequences direct the
    retention of the protein in a compartment
    or the transfer to another compartment in
    the cell.  Specialised protein coated
    vesicles are involved in the transport
    process.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
NMR spectroscopy
    A research technique that exploits the
    magnetic properties of certain atomic
    nuclei. It determines the physical and
    chemical properties of atoms or the
    molecules in which they are contained.

Protein structure
    Four levels
    ∙   Primary structure
    ∙   Secondary structure
    ∙   Tertiary structure
    ∙   Quaternary structure

    Our knowledge of protein structure /
    architecture has come principally from
    X-ray crystallography.

    X-rays are scattered by the electrons in
    the protein molecules making up the
    crystal and the scattered waves recombine
    to form a diffraction pattern that can be
    recorded on an X-ray sensitive surface.
    The pattern depends on the atomic
    arrangement in the crystal and may be
    converted mathematically to an electron
    density map from which the molecular model
    is built.

    Recently, improvements in NMR spectroscopy
    have allowed the structures of small
    proteins to be determined in solution and
    these are found to be in close agreement
    with the corresponding crystal structures.

Primary structure
Primary sequence
Amino acid sequence
    The order in which amino acids are linked
    via peptide bonds.

    The primary structure determines all the
    higher levels of structure.

Secondary structure
    Local regular folding stabilised by
    hydrogen bonds between backbone
    peptide groups e.g. α-helix, β-sheet.

    These are regions of regular
    polypeptide backbone folding due to
    favoured rotations of two of the three
    bonds in the backbone (the other bond
    is the rigid peptide bond).

    The two most energetically favourable
    secondary structures are the α-helix
    and β-sheet (two types: parallel and
    antiparallel) which were originally
    predicted by Linus Pauling (dual Nobel
    Prize winner) in the 1950s.

Secondary structure elements
    α-helix
    β-sheet
    β-barrel

β-hairpins
    Two beta strands that look like a hairpin.

Supersecondary structure
Secondary structure motif
    A compact 3D protein structure of several
    adjacent elements of secondary structure
    that is smaller than a protein domain or a
    subunit.  Supersecondary structures can
    act as nucleations in the process of
    protein folding.

    Examples:
        β-hairpins
        α-helix hairpins
        β-α-β motifs.

Domain
    Supersecondary structures form domains.

    A relatively stable independently folded
    region within the tertiary structure of a
    globular region. A protein might contain
    one, two or more domains, which often have
    a particular function associated with them
    (such as a ligand binding function).

    Mature proteins are comprised of one or
    more domains.

Tertiary structure
    The three-dimensional arrangement of all
    the atoms in the protein.

Quaternary structure
 ★  Interaction is non-covalent.

    Has subunits:
        dimers (2 subunits)
        trimers (3)
        tetramers (4) etc.

    The way in which several polypeptide
    chains associate in a multi-subunit
    protein.

Glycine
Glu
G
    An amino acid.
    Rarely found in an alpha helix, as it
    tends to bend too freely and therefore it
    deforms the helix. It is commonly found in
    u-turns.

β-turn
 ★  Found between strands of anti-parallel
    β-sheet.

Turn
    Allow polypeptide chains to change
    direction.

    Different types?
    ∙   U-turn
    ∙   β-turn

    Commonly consist of 4 AAs, with the second
    one (from the N-terminal end) often being
    Pro. Because the side-chain of Pro
    connects back onto the α-amino group of
    the AA, it introduces a natural bend in a
    polypeptide chain that is useful for
    changing direction.

Proline
Pro
P
    Breaks α-helices as it cannot form a
    hydrogen bond with its α-amino nitrogen
    and the rotation around its Cα-N bond is
    restricted.

α helix

    Hydrogen bonds:
        ∘   Optimises hydrogen bonding between
            the backbone carbonyl =O of
            residue n and the backbone amide
            -NH of residue (n + 4).
        ∘   These bonds point to approximately
            parallel to the helix axis.
        ∘   The sidechains point out from the
            helix axis.

    The most common secondary structure in
    proteins.

    Proliferation:
        Haemoglobin has about 75% helix.
        Antibodies have none.

    The length of a single helix can vary from
    one turn to over a hundred turns (as in
    keratin), the average being between 3 and
    5 (10-20 residues).

    The presence of some amino acids does not
    favour α-helix formation and certain
    sidechains may clash sterically or repel
    each other.
        See &#34;Glycine&#34;.
        See &#34;Proline&#34;.

Beta strand
Beta-strand
β-strand
    A stretch of polypeptide chain typically 3
    to 10 amino acids long with backbone in an
    almost fully extended conformation.

    The higher-level association of β sheets
    has been implicated in formation of the
    protein aggregates and fibrils observed in
    many human diseases, notably the
    amyloidoses such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease.

Beta-sheet
Beta sheet
β-pleated sheet
β-sheet
    The 2nd most common secondary structure in
    proteins.

    Beta-strands are connected by backbone
    hydrogen bonds.

    The peptide backbone in the β-pleated
    sheet is extended and the hydrogen bonds
    are formed between different parts of a
    single polypeptide chain running in either
    a parallel or antiparallel direction.
    Viewed side-on the sheet has a zigzag
    (pleated) structure with the amino acid
    sidechains pointing alternatively up and
    down. The sheet is not flat but twisted.

    Proteins contain variable amounts of
    β-sheet and there are, as with the
    α-helix, constraints on which amino acids
    are tolerated. The size and charge of
    sidechains is an exen more important
    consideration in β-sheet structures, and
    once again proline is unwelcome!

Ramachandran plots
    The Ramachandran plot is a prediction of
    which rotation angles around an α-carbon
    are allowed.

    The white area of the plot represents
    sterically forbidden conformations.

    For some rotations of φ (phy) and ψ (psi),
    the side-chains of two amino acids in a
    polypeptide would collide.

    More formally, the side-chains would
    approach each other within their van der
    Waals radii and this type of interaction
    is sterically forbidden.

Cytosol
Intracellular Fluid (ICF)
Cytoplasmic Matrix
    The liquid found inside cells. It is
    separated into compartments by membranes.
    For example, the mitochondrial matrix
    separates the mitochondrion into
    compartments.

Peptide backbone
    The non-R group of amino acid polymers,
    consisting literally of -N-C-C-N-C-C-N-.

Alpha carbon
Cα
C_α
α carbon
    The alpha carbon in organic molecules
    refers to the first carbon atom that
    attaches to a functional group, such as a
    carbonyl. The second carbon atom is called
    the beta carbon, and the system continues
    naming in alphabetical order with Greek
    letters.

    The nomenclature can also be applied to
    the hydrogen atoms attached to the
    carbons. A hydrogen attached to an alpha
    carbon is called an alpha-hydrogen, a
    hydrogen on the beta-carbon is a beta
    hydrogen, and so on.


    Proteins and amino acids

    Alpha-carbon (α-carbon) is also a term
    that applies to proteins and amino acids.
    It is the backbone carbon before the
    carbonyl carbon. Therefore, reading along
    the backbone of a typical protein would
    give a sequence of N, α-C, carbonyl C, N,
    α-C, carbonyl C, N, α-C, carbonyl C, etc.
    (when reading in the N to C direction).
    The α-carbon is where the different
    substituents attach to each different
    amino acid. That is, the groups hanging
    off the chain at the α-carbon are what
    give amino acids their diversity. These
    groups give the α-carbon its stereogenic
    properties for every amino acid except for
    glycine. Therefore, the α-carbon is a
    stereocenter for every amino acid except
    glycine. Glycine also does not have a
    β-carbon, while every other amino acid
    does.

    The α-carbon of an amino acid is
    significant in protein folding. When
    describing a protein, which is a chain of
    amino acids, one often approximates the
    location of each amino acid as the
    location of its α-carbon. In general,
    α-carbons of adjacent amino acids in a
    protein are about 3.8 ångströms (380
    picometers) apart.

Motif
    ∙ Sequence motif
    ∙ Structural motif
        See &#34;supersecondary structure&#34;.

Sequence motif
    A sequence pattern of nucleotides in a DNA
    sequence or amino acids in a protein.

Structural motif
    See &#34;supersecondary structure&#34;.

    A pattern in a protein structure formed by
    the spatial arrangement of amino acids.

    In a chain-like biological molecule, such
    as a protein or nucleic acid, a structural
    motif is a supersecondary structure, which
    also appears in a variety of other
    molecules. Motifs do not allow us to
    predict the biological functions: they are
    found in proteins and enzymes with
    dissimilar functions.

    Because the relationship between primary
    structure and tertiary structure is not
    straightforward, two biopolymers may share
    the same motif yet lack appreciable
    primary structure similarity. In other
    words, a structural motif does not have to
    be associated with a sequence motif. Also,
    the existence of a sequence motif does not
    necessarily imply a distinctive structure.
    In most DNA motifs, for example, it is
    assumed that the DNA of that sequence does
    not deviate from the normal &#34;double
    helical&#34; structure.

Catalytic activity
    The katal (symbol: kat) is the SI unit of
    catalytic activity.
    1 kat = 1 mol/s
    Enzyme units are, however, still more
    commonly used than the katal in practice
    at present, especially in biochemistry.

    The enzyme unit (U) is a unit for the
    amount of a particular enzyme.

U
Enzyme unit
EU
    1 μmol of product formed per minute.

    One U is defined as the amount of the
    enzyme that produces a certain amount of
    enzymatic activity, that is, the amount
    that catalyzes the conversion of 1 micro
    mole of substrate per minute. The
    conditions also have to be specified: one
    usually takes a temperature of 25°C and
    the pH value and substrate concentration
    that yield the maximal substrate
    conversion rate.

    The enzyme unit was adopted by the
    International Union of Biochemistry in
    1964. Since the minute is not an SI unit,
    the enzyme unit is discouraged in favour
    of the katal, the unit recommended by the
    General Conference on Weights and Measures
    in 1978 and officially adopted in 1999.
    One katal is the amount of enzyme that
    converts 1 mole of substrate per second,
    so,
    1 U = 1/60 micro katal = 16.67 nano katal.

Oxidoreductase
    « enzyme redox catalyst »

    An enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of
    electrons from one molecule, the
    reductant, also called the electron donor,
    to another the oxidant, also called the
    electron acceptor. This group of enzymes
    usually utilizes NADP or NAD+ as
    cofactors.

    For example, an enzyme that catalyzed this
    reaction would be an oxidoreductase:

    A⁻ + B → A + B⁻

Oxidase
    « oxygen-using oxidoreductase »
    Any enzyme that catalyzes an
    oxidation-reduction reaction involving
    molecular oxygen (O2) as the electron
    acceptor. In these reactions, oxygen is
    reduced to water (H2O) or hydrogen
    peroxide (H2O2).

    The oxidases are a subclass of the
    oxidoreductases.

Biogenic
    A biogenic substance is a substance
    produced by life processes. It may be
    either constituents, or secretions, of
    plants or animals. A more specific name
    for these substances is biomolecules.

Ortho-substitution
Ortho-
    Two substituents occupy positions next to
    each other, which may be numbered 1 and 2.
    In the diagram, these positions are marked
    R and ortho.

Meta-substitution
Meta-
    The substituents occupy positions 1 and 3
    (corresponding to R and meta in the
    diagram).

Para-substitution
Para-
    The substituents occupy the opposite ends
    (positions 1 and 4, corresponding to R and
    para in the diagram). The toluidines serve
    as an example for these three types of
    substitution.

Catalyst
    A substance that increases the rate of a
    chemical reaction without being consumed
    itself.

Competitive inhibitor
    An inhibitor that competes with the
    substrate for the active site of an
    enzyme. Competitive inhibitors are usually
    similar in shape to the substrate. The
    inhibition can be overcome by adding more
    substrate.

Equilibrium
    The state of a chemical reaction where the
    forward and reverse processes occur at the
    same time i.e. the concentrations of
    reactants and products are no longer
    changing.

Feedback inhibition
    The process by which the final product of
    a series of reactions inhibits the first
    reaction in the series.

Turnover number
k_cat
kcat
    The number of moles of substrate that
    react to form product per mole of enzyme
    per unit time (when the enzyme is fully
    saturated with substrate).  It has the
    units of s⁻¹ and can be calculated by
    dividing V_max by the enzyme
    concentraction.

    The maximum number of molecules of
    substrate that an enzyme can convert to
    product per catalytic site per unit of
    time.

Stereoisomers (pl.)
Stereoisomeric (adj.)
    Isomeric molecules that have the same
    molecular formula and sequence of bonded
    atoms (constitution), but that differ only
    in the three-dimensional orientations of
    their atoms in space.

Enantiomers (pl.)
Enantiomeric (adj.)
    One of two stereoisomers that are mirror
    images of each other that are
    non-superposable (not identical), much as
    one&#39;s left and right hands are the same
    except for opposite orientation.

Diastereomers (pl.)
Diastereomeric (adj.)
    Stereoisomers that are not enantiomers.

Stereoselectivity
Stereoconvergence (opp.)
    A property of a chemical reaction.

    Where a single reactant forms an unequal
    mixture of stereoisomers during the
    non-stereospecific creation of a new
    stereocenter or during the
    non-stereospecific transformation of a
    pre-existing one.

    The selectivity arises from differences in
    steric effects and electronic effects in
    the mechanistic pathways leading to the
    different products.

Stereoconvergence
Stereoselectivity (opp.)
    When the reaction of two different
    stereoisomers yield a single product
    stereoisomer.

Stereospecificity
Stereospecific (adj.)
Geometrical specificity
    **/enzyme-reaction-stereospecificity.pdf

    All enzyme-catalysed reactions are
    stereospecific.

    The property of a reaction mechanism that
    leads to different stereoisomeric reaction
    products from different stereoisomeric
    reactants, or which operates on only one
    (or a subset) of the
    stereoisomers.

    vs Stereoselectivity
        A stereospecific mechanism specifies
        the stereochemical outcome of a given
        reactant, whereas a stereoselective
        reaction selects products from those
        made available by the same,
        non-specific mechanism acting on a
        given reactant. Given a single,
        stereoisomerically pure starting
        material, a stereospecific mechanism
        will give 100% of a particular
        stereoisomer (or no reaction),
        although loss of stereochemical
        integrity can easily occur through
        competing mechanisms with different
        stereochemical outcomes. A
        stereoselective process will normally
        give multiple products even if only
        one mechanism is operating on an
        isomerically pure starting material.

Stereoselectivity
    The property of a reactant mixture where a
    non-stereospecific mechanism allows for
    the formation of multiple products, but
    where one (or a subset) of the products is
    favored by factors, such as steric access,
    that are independent of the mechanism.

    Describes the rate of enzymatic reactions
    by relating ‘v’ to [S].

         velocity = rate of product formation

Km
K_M
Michaelis constant
    http://goo.gl/nm3oLo
    **/hyperbolic-eq-km.png

    The concentraction of substrate required
    for an enzyme-catalysed reaction to
    proceed at half the maximum rate. The
    units for K_M are units of concentration.

    Think of a as:
        ∘   A measrue of the affinity of the
            enzyme for its substrate.
        ∘   A property of the enzyme.

    An enzyme with a high Km has a low
    affinity for its substrate, and requires a
    greater concentration of substrate to
    achieve Vmax.

    http://goo.gl/SfOUPj?image
    An enzyme with a low Km relative to the
    physiological concentration of substrate,
    as shown above, is normally saturated with
    substrate, and will act at a more or less
    constant rate, regardless of variations in
    the concentration of substrate within the
    physiological range.

    http://goo.gl/zOwJhH?image
    An enzyme with a high Km relative to the
    physiological concentration of substrate,
    as shown above, is not normally saturated
    with substrate, and its activity will vary
    as the concentration of substrate varies,
    so that the rate of formation of product
    will depend on the availability of
    substrate.

Nucleation
The nucleation mechanism of protein folding:
    Involves the formation of α-helices and
    β-sheet structures early in the folding
    process.

Zymogen
Proenzyme
    An inactive enzyme precursor.
    A zymogen requires a biochemical change
    (such as a hydrolysis reaction revealing
    the active site, or changing the
    configuration to reveal the active site)
    for it to become an active enzyme. The
    biochemical change usually occurs in a
    lysosome where a specific part of the
    precursor enzyme is cleaved in order to
    activate it. The inactivating piece which
    is cleaved off can be a peptide unit, or
    can be independently folding domains
    comprising more than 100 residues.
    Although they limit the enzyme&#39;s ability,
    these n-terminal extensions of the enzyme
    or a “prosegment” often aid in the
    stabilizing and folding of the enzyme they
    inhibit.

Pepsin
    A protease.

    An endopeptidase.

    An enzyme involved in protein digestion.

    Created in the stomach&#39;s mucosa.

    Its substrates are food proteins and
    pepsinogen in the stomach.

    An enzyme whose zymogen (pepsinogen) is
    released by the chief cells in the stomach
    and that degrades food proteins into
    peptides.

Autolytic activation
    When a protein proteolyses itself in order
    to become activated.

Catalytic activation
    After the autolytic activation of
    pepsinogen, the pepsin will proteolyse
    other pepsinogens. This is an example of
    catalytic activation.

Pepsinogen
    The zymogen of pepsin.

    Composition (3 peptides):
        Signal peptide
        Catalytic peptide
            (active domain, catalytic domain).
        Activation peptide
            (folded in on the catalytic
            domain, suppressing the activity
            of the catalytic domain, occludes
            the active site).

    Activation:
 ★      Converted to pepsin when in the
        presence of protons.
        Protons change the charge on the
        protein and causes an electrostatic
        interaction to happen which causes a
        conformational change in the protein
        which causes the activation peptide to
        move away from the catalytic domain,
        allowing the catalytic domain to be
        active, the pepsinogen then cuts off
        the activation domain (this is called
        autolytic activation). The pepsinogen
        is now a pepsin and will begin
        activating other pepsinogens.

Native state [of a protein or nucleic acid]
    Its properly folded and/or assembled form,
    which is operative and functional. The
    native state of a biomolecule may possess
    all four levels of biomolecular structure,
    with the secondary through quaternary
    structure being formed from weak
    interactions along the covalently-bonded
    backbone. This is in contrast to the
    denatured state, in which these weak
    interactions are disrupted, leading to the
    loss of these forms of structure and
    retaining only the biomolecule&#39;s primary
    structure.

Denatured state
    See &#34;Native state&#34;.

Denaturation
    A process in which proteins or nucleic
    acids lose the quaternary structure,
    tertiary structure and secondary structure
    which is present in their native state, by
    application of some external stress or
    compound such as a strong acid or base, a
    concentrated inorganic salt, an organic
    solvent (e.g., alcohol or chloroform),
    radiation or heat.

E_a
    The energy barrier that must be overcome
    for a reaction to start.

Electrochemical gradient
    A gradient of electrochemical potential,
    usually for an ion that can move across a
    membrane. The gradient consists of two
    parts, the electrical potential and a
    difference in the chemical concentration
    across a membrane. The difference of
    electrochemical potentials can be
    interpreted as a type of potential energy
    available for work in a cell. The energy
    is stored in the form of chemical
    potential, which accounts for an ion&#39;s
    concentration gradient across a cell
    membrane, and electrostatic energy, which
    accounts for an ion&#39;s tendency to move
    under influence of the transmembrane
    potential.

Anfinsen Experiment:
    The seminal experiment reported by
    Anfinsen demonstrated that

    RNase A could be fully denatured by:
    1.  Reducing the disulfide bonds (using
        β-mercaptoethanol)
    2.  dissolving in 8 M urea and then fully
        renatured on diluting out the urea and
        allowing he disulfides to reoxidize.
        Essentially full return of catalytic
        activity was obtained. This experiment
        demonstrated that all the information
        necessary to determine the
        three-dimensional fold was
        incorporated in the amino acid
        sequence. A large number of proteins
        have now been shown to be able to be
        renatured in similar experiments.
        Thus, it is clear that virtually all
        proteins, under appropriate
        conditions, can be reversibly unfolded
        and refolded into their native
        structure under in vitro conditions.
        This is known as spontaneous folding.

Histidine
    An α-amino acid with an imidazole
    functional group.

    An essential amino acid in humans and
    other mammals. It was initially thought
    that it was only essential for infants,
    but longer-term studies established that
    it is also essential for adult humans.

Subcellular localization
    The cells of eukaryotic organisms are
    elaborately subdivided into functionally
    distinct membrane bound compartments. Some
    major constituents of eukaryotic cells

    Benzothiazine polymer.

    Largely responsible for red hair and
    freckles.

Neuromelanin
    Found in the brain

    Function remains obscure.

Melanin
    A broad term for a group of natural
    pigments found in most organisms.

    Melanin is produced by the oxidation of
    the amino acid tyrosine, followed by
    polymerization.

    The pigment is produced in a specialized
    group of cells known as melanocytes.

    There are three basic types of melanin:
    ∙   eumelanin
    ∙   pheomelanin
    ∘   neuromelanin

Melanosome
    Synthesised in the skin melanocytes.

    The cellular site of synthesis, storage
    and transport of melanin.

Melanoblast
    Precursor cell of a melanocyte.

Melanocytes
    Melanin-producing cells located in the
    bottom layer (the stratum basale) of the
    skin&#39;s epidermis, the middle layer of the
    eye (the uvea), the inner ear, meninges,
    bones, and heart.  Melanin is the pigment
    primarily responsible for skin color.

    One epidermal melanocyte makes contact
    with about 30-40 keratinocytes.

Melanogenesis
    Through a process called melanogenesis,
    melanocytes cells produce melanin, which
    is a pigment found in the skin, eyes, and
    hair. This melanogenesis leads to a
    long-lasting pigmentation, which is in
    contrast to the pigmentation that
    originates from oxidation of
    already-existing melanin.

    negative electrical charge, though
    multiple positive and negative charges can
    be present.

    different locations within that molecule.
    Zwitterions are sometimes also called
    inner salts.

Alzheimer&#39;s Disease
    Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive
    neurodegenerative disorder that leads to
    dementia (a defect in cognition affecting
    memory, language, problem solving etc.).
    There are a variety of suggested causes
    for AD, the most prominent of which
    feature misfolding and/or aggregation of
    proteins that cause (or associated with)
    the destruction of brain tissue.

    Two proteins that appear to be major
    players in the pathology of AD:
        Amyloid precursor protein (APP)
        Tau protein.

    As well as the transmissible form of the
    disease, there are genetic and sporadic
    forms.

    between two molecules. High affinity means
    high attraction (and ultimately strong
    interaction).

    The two types of polypeptide chains in
    haemoglobin. Note: this is not related to
    alpha helices and beta sheets.

Carbaminohemoglobin
Carbhaemoglobin
Carbohaemoglobin
    Lower haemoglobin&#39;s affinity for oxygen
    via the Bohr effect.

    Formed when CO₂ binds to haemoglobin at an
    allosteric site.
        I.e. doesn&#39;t bind to the heme.

    Hb can bind to 4 molecules of CO₂.

    The CO₂ molecules form an amide linkage to
    the 4 N-terminal of the 4 protein chains
    in the deoxy-Hb. Thus, one hemoglobin
    molecule can transport four CO₂ molecules
    back to the lungs, where they are released
    when the molecule changes back to the
    Oxy-Hb form.

    molecule is not bound to the haem, i.e.
    haemoglobin that is deoxygenated.

    Found near respiring tissue.

    subunit.

    2 different types of globin chains in
    normal adult haemoglobin:
        Alpha (α) chains
        Beta (β) chains
    These two globins differ in amino acid
    sequence but have the same characteristic
    shape. There are two alpha and two beta
    chains in normal adult haemoglobin, that
    together give a quaternary structure to
    the haemoglobin.

    The protein part of haemoglobin.

HbM
Hb M
    A group of abnormal Hb&#39;s in which a single
    AA substitution favors the formation of
    methemoglobin in spite of normal
    quantities of methemoglobin reductase.

    Hb that has a mutation at the proximal or
    distal histidyl residues.

    Some tend to favor the Fe(III) state.

            replaced by tyrosine
        Hb M Hyde Park, β92His→Tyr
        Hb MBoston, α58His→Tyr
        Hb MSaskatoon, β63His→Tyr
        Hb MMilwaukee-1, β67Val→Glu

Methaemoglobin
Methemoglobin
Ferrihemoglobin
met-Hb
    Pronounced &#34;met-hemoglobin&#34;.

    A form of haemoglobin in which the iron is
    Fe(III) rather than Fe(II).

    Being a &#39;form&#39; of, it is still hemoglobin
    strictly speaking.

    In binding, oxygen temporarily and
    reversibly oxidizes (Fe²⁺) to (Fe³⁺) while
    oxygen temporarily turns into superoxide,
    thus iron must exist in the +2 oxidation
    state to bind oxygen. If superoxide ion
    associated to Fe³⁺ is protonated, the
    hemoglobin iron will remain oxidized and
    incapable of binding oxygen.

    The enzyme methemoglobin reductase will be
    able to eventually reactivate
    methemoglobin by reducing the iron center.

Electronegativity
    Helps determine the nomenclature of ionic
    compounds. Usually, we write the more
    electropositive atoms first. However, in
    the case of, say, NH₃, we make an
    exception.

Oxygen
    Electronegative.

Nitrogen
    Electropositive.
        NH₃ when mixed with water is
        represented as NH₄⁺ so, therefore,
        is electropositive, although H+ atoms
        are even more electropositive.

    affinity to the ion exchanger. It can be
    used for almost any kind of charged
    molecule including large proteins, small
    nucleotides and amino acids. The solution
    to be injected is usually called a sample,
    and the individually separated components
    are called analytes. It is often used in
    protein purification, water analysis, and
    quality control.

VLDL
Very low density lipoprotein

Proteolysis
    Hydrolysis of peptide bonds (usually).

    The breakdown of proteins and
    polypeptides.

    Most commonly achieved by cellular enzymes
    called proteases.

Peptide bond
Amide bond (colloquially)
    Formation:
        The carboxylic acid group of one amino
        acid condenses with the amino group of
        the next amino acid and water is
        removed. The resulting amide bond is
        called a peptide bond.

    ∘   The peptide bond gives proteins the
        stiffness that they need to hold their
        structure together.
    ∘   X-ray crystallography was used to
        determine the structure.
    ∘   Unique because it&#39;s not exactly a
        single bond and not exactly a double
        bond but it has partial double-bond
        character. Because of that, it leads
        to planarity.
    ∘   Remember from sp2 hybridization in
        chemistry, if you have sp2 hybridized
        systems it&#39;s flat so you can think of
        these bonds as sp2, they&#39;re planar,
        the planarity allows pi-bonding
        overlap to be maximized and it means
        they&#39;re stiff, so there isn&#39;t free
        rotation, even though in a simple
        diagram it may look like a single
        bond, the resonance form shows that it
        has a double bond character.
    ∘   So the peptide bond leads to 2
        resonance structures, the double bond
        resonance structure displaying a
        dipole (O- and N+).
    ∘   Dipole
        ∘   Oxygen has a tendency to be a
            little bit negative.
        ∘   Nitrogen has a tendency to be a
            little bit positive.
        ∘   The dipole is important for the
            protein&#39;s properties.
    ∘   Rotational barrier of 80kJ/mol so
        there isn&#39;t free rotation around the
        peptide bond.
    ∘   Predominantly trans (as opposed to
        cis).
    ∘   Cis is less favoured as it is very
        crowded sterically (the side-chains
        bang into one another). Unlikely to
        occur (1/1000) unless we are talking
        about the bond that preceeds proline
        and in that case about 10% of the
        bonds that preceed proline can be cic
        and that&#39;s because of weird proline
        side-chain.
    ∘   For a trans peptide bond, the dihedral
        angle is 180° by definition.
    ∘   In a cis peptide bond, the dihedral
        angle is 0° by definition.
    ∘   The peptide bond C-N is 0.13Å shorter
        than Cα-N bond. C=O is 0.02Å longer
        than those for ketones and aldehydes.
    ∘   The peptide bond is not short enough
        to be a double, not long enough to be
        a single.

    ∘   When we think about the stretch of
        amimno acids in a protein we are
        actually thinking about a side-chain,
        an α-carbon to carbonyl bond that is
        freely rotatable, a peptide bond
        that&#39;s quite stiff and then an amino
        to alpha carbon bond that is freely
        rotatable, followed by another peptide
        bond that&#39;s quite stiff.

Glycolysis
    This pathway describes how the very common
    carbohydrate (i.e. sugar), glucose, is
    broken down. One glocuse molecule
    generates 2 pyruvates and in the process a
    small number of ATP and NADH + H+
    molecules are produced.  Subsequently,
    (although not part of glycolysis) each
    pyruvates is converted to an acetyl-CoA
    molecule, a 2C molecule, in a step which
    also  generates some NADH + H+ and CO2
    (this is CO2 that we exhale when our
    bodies are doing work).

Nuclear receptors
    The chemical messenger is usually
    lipophilic. This is because to get to the
    nucleus from outside the cell the
    messenger must be able to pass through the
    cell membrane.

Ionotropic receptor
Metabotropic (in contrast with)
    Multimer (at least 4 or 5 individual
    subunits which comprise the pore).

                Binds transmitters.
        ∙   Membrane spanning domain.
                Forms the ion channel.

    When a transmitter (or ligand) binds to an
    ionotropic receptor, the channel becomes
    activated, and ions can flow through the
    channel. Ionotropic receptors generally
    mediate postsynaptic effects. The
    postsynaptic potentials arise within a
    millisecond or two of an action potential
    invading the presynaptic terminal and
    usually last for tens of milliseconds oro

Metabotropic receptor (naïvely)
    The most numerous type of receptor on the

    Drugs currently target only 10% of the
    known G protein-coupled receptors
    (Therefore, it&#39;s a good field to get
    into).

    Activated by a diverse range of ligands
    including:
        Hormones
        Neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine)

    A type of membrane receptor of eukaryotic
    cells that acts through a secondary
    messenger. It may be located at the
    surface of the cell or in vesicles.

    The eventual movement of ions through a
    channel depends on one or more metabolic
    steps.

    Do not have ion channels as part of their
    structure; instead, they affect other
    channels by the activation of intermediate
    molecules called G-proteins. For this
    reason, metabotropic receptors are also
    called G-protein-coupled receptors.

    Structure:
        ∙   Extracellular domain
                ∘   Contains a
                    neurotransmitter/agonist

        ∙   Intracellular domain
                ∘   Binds to G-proteins
                    (coupled to g a G
                    protein).
        ∘   A long string of amino acids.

    When the agonist binds to the receptor,
    the G protein increases or decreases the
    activity of an enzyme. The enzyme controls
    the amount of &#34;second messengers&#34;. This
    results in a cellular response.

Lock and key model
    Model of the way drugs and receptors work.

Agonist
    A chemical that binds to a receptor and
    activates the receptor to produce a
    biological response. Whereas an agonist
    causes an action, an antagonist blocks the
    action of the agonist and an inverse
    agonist causes an action opposite to that
    of the agonist.

    Binds to a receptor, changes its shape,
    causes an effect.

    Could be a drug or an endogenous chemical
    messenger.

    See &#34;Receptor Agonist&#34;.

Physiological Agonist
    A substance that creates the same bodily
    responses but does not bind to the same
    receptor.

Neurotransmitter
    Example:
        Dopamine

    A First Messenger.

Agonist (common)
Receptor Agonist
Endogenous Agonist (for a particular receptor)
First Messenger
Chemical messenger
Natural chemical messenger
    Example:
        Dopamine

    Types:
        Hormones
        Neurotransmitters

    Typically don&#39;t go into the cell; Usually
    just interact with the outside and have
    all sorts of inside effects by changing
    cell signalling pathways.

    A compound naturally produced by the body
    that binds to and activates that receptor.
    For example, the endogenous agonist for
    serotonin receptors is serotonin, and the
    endogenous agonist for dopamine receptors
    is dopamine.

    See &#34;Endogenous&#34;.

Antagonist
Receptor Antagonist
    A type of receptor ligand or drug that
    blocks or dampens agonist-mediated
    responses rather than provoking a
    biological response itself upon binding to
    a receptor. In pharmacology, antagonists
    have affinity but no efficacy for their
    cognate receptors, and binding will
    disrupt the interaction and inhibit the
    function of an agonist or inverse agonist
    at receptors. Antagonists mediate their
    effects by binding to the active
    (orthosteric = right place) site or to
    allosteric (= other place) sites on
    receptors, or they may interact at unique
    binding sites not normally involved in the
    biological regulation of the receptor&#39;s
    activity.

    Binds to the receptor but doesn&#39;t change
    its shape (i.e. does not turn it on).

Efficacy
    The quality of being efficient or
    producing an effect or effects; efficient
    power; effectual agency.

Signalling Pathway
    One signal turns another one on which
    turns on the next, etc.

    Chains/series of signals.

    Example
        P-A activates B. B becomes P-B.  P-B

Salivary glands
    Saliva (neutral pH) contains mucous (made
    of glycoproteins (proteins cantaining
    oligosaccharide chains or glycans)) and
    amylase which starts the digestion of
    carbohydrates.

Glycoprotein
    Contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans)
    covalently attached to polypeptide
    side-chains.

    The carbohydrate is attached to the
    protein in a cotranslational or
    posttranslational modification. This
    process is known as glycosylation.
    Secreted extracellular proteins are often
    glycosylated. In proteins that have
    segments extending extracellularly, the
    extracellular segments are also
    glycosylated. Glycoproteins are often
    important integral membrane proteins,
    where they play a role in cell–cell
    interactions. Glycoproteins are also
    formed in the cytosol, but their functions
    and the pathways producing these
    modifications in this compartment are less
    well understood.

Digestion of nucleic acids
Nucleic acid digestion
    Digestion is how we receive nucleic acids
    needed for our cells to grow, specifically
    DNA, RNA, rRNA, mRNA, tRNA.

    Foods that are high in nucleic acids are
    fish and flesh based.

    DNA and RNA are easily hydrolysed at least
    partially by the stomach acid.

    Intestinal nucleases then start to
    hydrolyse the phosphodiester bonds between
    nucleotides.

    Phosphatase breaks down and releases the
    nucleosides which are then absorbed via
    nucleoside transporters.

    The sugar phosphate backbone
    is initially cleaved and this fragmented
    DNA is hydrolysed into nucleotides in the
    intestine by these pancreatic nucleases.

    liquids that are normally immiscible
    (nonmixable or unblendable). Emulsions are
    part of a more general class of two-phase
    systems of matter called colloids.
    Although the terms colloid and emulsion
    are sometimes used interchangeably,
    emulsion should be used when both the
    dispersed and the continuous phase are
    liquids. In an emulsion, one liquid (the
    dispersed phase) is dispersed in the other
    (the continuous phase).

Digestion of lipids
Lipid digestion
    Cannot take place in an aqueous
    environment.

    Must take place in a semi-aqueous
    environment.

    Dietary lipids:
        ∙   TAG (mostly)
        ∙   Phospholipid
        ∙   Cholesterol
                In the form of cholesterol
                esters.

                Non-essenstial because we
                synthesise it but is an
                important precursor to Vitamin
                D, bile salts and steroid
                hormones.

                While a lot of foods that
                contain high levels of
                cholesterol aren&#39;t good for
                you, cholesterol itself isn&#39;t
                directly related to
                cholesterol content in the
                blood.

        vitamins in faeces.

        Caused by conditions that interfere
        with bile or pancreatic lipase
        secretion, i.e. pancreatitis, gall
        bladder or liver diseases

    Xenical is a diet pill.

    After being absorbed, MAG is converted to
    DAG then to TAG. Other diet pills target
    enzymes that catalyse this process to
    prevent TAG being created. Also,
    cholesterol esters are made from the MAG.

    TAGs are then turned into chylomicrons in
    the ER/golgi. The chylomicrons are then
    sent to the lymph where they merge with
    the cell membrane (exocytosis), ejecting
    their contents into the lymph.

Exocytosis
    The durable, energy-consuming process by
    which a cell directs the contents of
    secretory vesicles out of the cell
    membrane and into the extracellular space.
    These membrane-bound vesicles contain
    soluble proteins to be secreted to the
    extracellular environment, as well as
    membrane proteins and lipids that are sent
    to become components of the cell membrane.

    See &#34;Lipid digestion&#34;.

    down into its metabolites.

    Widely used for the determination of free
    glucose in body fluids.

    Widely used coupled to peroxidase reaction
    that visualizes colorimetrically the
    formed H₂O₂, for the determination of free
    glucose in sera or blood plasma for
    diagnostics, using spectrometric assays
    manually or with automated procedures, and
    even point of use rapid assays.

Glycaemic index (of a particular food)
GI
    Represents the total rise in a person&#39;s
    blood sugar level following consumption of
    the food; it may or may not represent the
    rapidity of the rise in blood sugar.

    A low-GI food will release glucose more
    slowly and steadily, which leads to more
    suitable postprandial (after meal) blood
    glucose readings. A high-GI food causes a
    more rapid rise in blood glucose levels
    and is suitable for energy recovery after
    exercise or for a person experiencing
    hypoglycemia.

    A number associated with a particular type
    of food that indicates the food&#39;s effect
    on a person&#39;s blood glucose (also called
    blood sugar) level.

    Typically ranges between 50 and 100, where
    100 represents the standard, an equivalent
    amount of pure glucose.

Fructose
    A monosaccharide.

Glucagon
    Regulates the breakdown of glycogen to
    glucose.

    A peptide hormone, produced by alpha cells
    of the pancreas, that raises the
    concentration of glucose in the
    bloodstream. Its effect is opposite that
    of insulin, which lowers the glucose
    concentration. The pancreas releases
    glucagon when the concentration of glucose
    in the bloodstream falls too low. Glucagon
    causes the liver to convert stored
    glycogen into glucose, which is released
    into the bloodstream. High blood glucose
    levels stimulate the release of insulin.
    Insulin allows glucose to be taken up and
    used by insulin-dependent tissues. Thus,
    glucagon and insulin are part of a
    feedback system that keeps blood glucose
    levels at a stable level.

    See &#34;Insulin&#34;. (opp)

Glycogen synthase
    An enzyme involved in converting glucose
    to glycogen.

    It takes short polymers of glucose and
    converts them into long polymers of
    glycogen.

    The reaction is highly regulated by
    allosteric effectors such as
    glucose-6-phosphate, by phosphorylation
    reactions, and indirectly triggered by the
    hormone insulin, which is secreted by the
    pancreas.

    See &#34;Insulin&#34;. (works alongside)

Gluconic acid
    Formed from the oxidation of
    glucose along with gluconate salts and
    gluconate esters occur widely in nature
    because such species.

Peroxidase
    Catalyzes a reaction of the form:
        ROOR&#39; + electron donor (2 e-) + 2H+ →
        ROH + R&#39;OH

Hexokinase.
    An enzyme.

    Phosphorylates hexoses (six-carbon
    sugars), forming hexose phosphate. In most
    organisms, glucose is the most important
    substrate of hexokinases, and
    glucose-6-phosphate the most important
    product.

Diabetes
    Type 1 - Insulin Dependent
        Results from the autoimmune
        destruction of the insulin-producing
        beta cells in the pancreas.
    Glucagonoma
        A rare tumor of the alpha cells of the
        pancreas that results in up to a
        1000-fold overproduction of the
        hormone glucagon.

Acetyl-CoA
Acetyl coenzyme A
    An important molecule in metabolism, used
    in many biochemical reactions. It is
    referred to as the &#34;Hub of Metabolism&#34;.
    Its main function is to convey the carbon
    atoms within the acetyl group to the
    citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) to be
    oxidized for energy production.

    See &#34;Coenzyme&#34;.
    See &#34;Cofactor&#34;.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase
E1
    The first component enzyme of pyruvate
    dehydrogenase complex (PDC). The pyruvate
    dehydrogenase complex contributes to
    transforming pyruvate into acetyl-CoA by a
    process called pyruvate decarboxylation.
    Acetyl-CoA may then be used in the citric
    acid cycle to carry out cellular
    respiration, so pyruvate dehydrogenase
    contributes to linking the glycolysis
    metabolic pathway to the citric acid cycle
    and releasing energy via NADH.

Thioester
    Compounds with the functional group
    C-S-CO-C. They are the product of
    esterification between a carboxylic acid
    and a thiol. Thioesters are widespread in
    biochemistry, the best-known derivative
    being acetyl-CoA.

Gallstones
Gall stones
    Crystalline concretion formed in the gall
    bladder by the accretion of bile
    components. Eventually, this leads to the
    rupture of the gall bladder.

    They can block ducts.

    If they block the pancreatic duct, things
    can&#39;t get out of the pancreas. The
    pancreas will start to self-digest. This
    is pancreatitis.

    Risk factors:
        Overweight
        High levels of cholesterol

Pyruvic acid
CH3COCOOH
Pyruvate (conj. base)
    An organic acid, has a carboxylic acid and
    a ketone functional group, and is the
    simplest of the alpha-keto acids. The
    carboxylate (COO−) anion of pyruvic acid,
    its Brønsted–Lowry conjugate base,
    CH3COCOO−, is known as pyruvate, and is a
    key intersection in several metabolic
    pathways.

    Can be made from glucose through
    glycolysis, converted back to
    carbohydrates (such as glucose) via
    gluconeogenesis, or to fatty acids through
    acetyl-CoA. It can also be used to
    construct the amino acid alanine and be
    converted into ethanol.
