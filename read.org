#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
Recent progress in pretraining LMs on large
textual corpora led to a surge of improvements
for downstream NLP tasks.

Whilst learning linguistic knowledge, these
models may also be storing relational
knowledge present in the training data, and
may be able to answer queries structured as
"fill-in-the-blank" cloze statements.

LMs have many advantages over structured KBs:
they require no schema engineering, allow
practitioners to query about an open class of
relations, are easy to extend to more data,
and require no human supervision to train.

We present an in-depth analysis of the
relational knowledge already present (without
fine-tuning) in a wide range of SOTA
pretrained LMs.

We find that (i) without fine-tuning, BERT
contains relational knowledge competitive with
traditional NLP methods that have some access
to oracle knowledge, (ii) BERT also does
remarkably well on open-domain QA against a
supervised baseline, and (iii) certain types
of factual knowledge are learned much more
readily than others by standard LM pretraining
approaches.

The surprisingly strong ability of these
models to recall factual knowledge without any
fine-tuning demonstrates their potential as
unsupervised open-domain QA systems.

The code to reproduce our analysis is
available at this https URL.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00744

:summary:
We explore using latent natural language
instructions as an expressive and
compositional representation of complex
actions for hierarchical decision making.

Rather than directly selecting micro-actions,
our agent first generates a latent plan in
natural language, which is then executed by a
separate model.

We introduce a challenging real-time strategy
game environment in which the actions of a
large number of units must be coordinated
across long time scales.

We gather a dataset of 76 thousand pairs of
instructions and executions from human play,
and train instructor and executor models.

Experiments show that models using natural
language as a latent variable significantly
outperform models that directly imitate human
actions.

The compositional structure of language proves
crucial to its effectiveness for action
representation.

We also release our code, models and data.

* You Only Need Attention to Traverse Trees
https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1030/

In recent NLP research, a topic of
interest is universal sentence encoding,
sentence representations that can be used
in any supervised task.

At the word sequence level, fully
attention-based models suffer from two
problems:
- a quadratic increase in memory
consumption with respect to the sentence
length, and
- an inability to capture and use
syntactic information.

Recursive neural nets can extract very
good syntactic information by traversing a
tree structure.

To this end, we propose Tree Transformer,
a model that captures phrase level syntax
for constituency trees as well as word-
level dependencies for dependency trees by
doing recursive traversal only with
attention.

Evaluation of this model on four tasks
gets noteworthy results compared to the
standard transformer and LSTM-based models
as well as tree-structured LSTMs.

Ablation studies to find whether
positional information is inherently
encoded in the trees and which type of
attention is suitable for doing the
recursive traversal are provided.

[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02621][The Machine that Builds Itself: How the Strengths of Lisp Family Languages Facilitate Building Complex and Flexible Bioinformatic Models]]

We address the need for expanding the presence of the Lisp family of programming languages in bioinformatics and computational biology research. Languages of this family, like Common Lisp, Scheme, or Clojure, facilitate the creation of powerful and flexible software models that are required for complex and rapidly evolving domains like biology. We will point out several important key features that distinguish languages of the Lisp family from other programming languages and we will explain how these features can aid researchers in becoming more productive and creating better code. We will also show how these features make these languages ideal tools for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. We will specifically stress the advantages of domain-specific languages (DSL): languages which are specialized to a particular area and thus not only facilitate easier research problem formulation, but also aid in the establishment of standards and best programming practices as applied to the specific research field at hand. DSLs are particularly easy to build in Common Lisp, the most comprehensive Lisp dialect, which is commonly referred to as the "programmable programming language." We are convinced that Lisp grants programmers unprecedented power to build increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that may ultimately transform machine learning and AI research in bioinformatics and computational biology.

*** Why Exploration is Difficult
Model-free RL methods like policy gradients and Q-learning explore by taking actions randomly. If, by chance, the random actions lead to a reward, they are reinforced, and the agent becomes more likely to take these beneficial actions in the future. This works well if rewards are dense enough for random actions to lead to a reward with reasonable probability. However, many of the more complicated games require long sequences of very specific actions to experience any reward, and such sequences are extremely unlikely to occur randomly.

If I used hacker news then I can review them really well because I can look at the comments.

I should then search for papers that have appeared on hacker news.

* [#A] Read these kinds of things
https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/rules-of-ml/

The thing about getting my reading from Google is I will learn the correct terminology for things, that have been discovered by Google's algorithms to be the correct terminology.
Until we have blockchain for language, this is the best way.

* Read on emacs lisp
** [#A] Good, short read
*** Multiple optional arguments as a list using &rest

* Everything in the terminal

If I can do more in emacs then I will feel less crazy deciding on things
to learn, such as on youtube. I don't really want to watch so many
partial videos. I want to complete more videos. That is my theory.

* Execellent and simple slides on quantum cryptography by Artur Ekert
[[$DUMP$HOME/notes2018/ws/quantum-cryptography/quantum_zak_bertrand.pdf][quantum_zak_bertrand.pdf]]

Amazing list of references at the end.
