Birthday Paradox
Birthday <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span>
    In a set of <span class="seleniumError">n</span> randomly chosen people, some
    pair of them will have the same birthday<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    By the pigeonhole principle, the
    <span class="interesting">probability</span> reaches <span class="zero">100</span><span class="subdued">%</span> when the number
    of people reaches <span class="seven">367</span> (<span class="kashyap">since</span> there are
    only <span class="six">366</span> possible birthdays, including
    February <span class="nine">29</span>).

    However, <span class="nine">99</span><span class="numberpunctuation">.</span><span class="nine">9</span><span class="subdued">%</span> <span class="interesting">probability</span> is reached <span class="codekeywords">with</span>

    <span class="three">23</span> people<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    These conclusions are based on the
    assumption that each day of the year
    (<span class="kashyap">excluding</span> February <span class="nine">29</span>) is equally
    <span class="interesting">probable</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a birthday<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

<span class="logic">or</span> <span class="seleniumError">error</span> reduction, linear <span class="failing">regression</span> can
be used to fit a <span class="interesting">predictive</span> model to an
observed data set of values of the
response <span class="logic">and</span> explanatory variables<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

After developing such a model, <span class="logic">if</span>
additional values of the explanatory
variables are collected without an
accompanying response value, the fitted
model can be used to make a <span class="interesting">prediction</span> of
the response<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

<span class="logic">If</span> the goal is to explain variation in the
response <span class="variable">variable</span> that can be attributed
to variation in the explanatory variables,
linear <span class="failing">regression</span> analysis can be applied
to quantify the strength of the
relationship between the response <span class="logic">and</span> the
explanatory variables, <span class="logic">and</span> in particular
to determine whether some explanatory
variables <span class="five">may</span> have <span class="seleniumError">no linear relationship</span>
<span class="codekeywords">with</span> the response at all, <span class="logic">or</span> to identify
which subsets of explanatory variables <span class="five">may</span>
contain redundant information about the
response<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Linear <span class="failing">regression</span> models are often fitted
using the least squares approach, <span class="logic">but</span> they
<span class="five">may</span> also be fitted in other ways, such as
by minimizing the <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>lack of fit<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> in some
other norm (<span class="kashyap">as</span> <span class="codekeywords">with</span> least absolute
deviations <span class="failing">regression</span>), <span class="logic">or</span> by minimizing a
penalized version of the least squares
cost <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> as in ridge <span class="failing">regression</span>
(<span class="allcaps">L</span><span class="two">2</span>-norm penalty) <span class="logic">and</span> lasso (<span class="allcaps">L</span><span class="one">1</span>-norm
penalty).

Conversely, the least squares approach can
be used to fit models that are <span class="seleniumError">not linear</span>
models<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Thus, although the terms <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>least squares<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>
<span class="logic">and</span> <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>linear model<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> are closely linked,

first-order formula
    A statement about the objects in a domain

homology
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>theory<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    A general way of associating a sequence of
    algebraic objects such as abelian groups
    <span class="logic">or</span> modules to other mathematical objects
    such as topological spaces<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

cohomology
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span><span class="seleniumError">noun</span><span class="morediscrete">]</span>
    A sequence of abelian groups associated to
    a topological space, often defined from a
    cochain complex<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>verb<span class="morediscrete">]</span>
    A method of assigning richer algebraic

abelian group
commutative group
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>a <span class="codekeywords">type</span> of group<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    A groups that obeys the axiom of

cochain complex
    Similar to a chain complex, <span class="codekeywords">except</span> that
    its homomorphisms follow a different
    convention<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The homology of a cochain complex is
    called its cohomology<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Usually <span class="logic">if</span> you have a partial <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span>,
    it<span class="quote">'</span>s because your types are <span class="seleniumError">incorrect</span> <span class="logic">and</span>
    you should <span class="failing">fix</span> your types rather than
    writing partial functions which guarantee

    A <span class="safe">good</span> <span class="awesome">example</span> of this is head<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    You <span class="seleniumError">shouldn't use</span> this <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> <span class="logic">or</span> write
    functions like it<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span> is in the <span class="codekeywords">type</span>, it says <span class="morediscrete">[</span>a<span class="morediscrete">]</span> -&gt;
    a which is actually impossible as far as
    total functions are concerned<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Why<span class="brightoperator2">?</span>

    Because you might have an empty list!

    <span class="highpriority">Instead</span>, a more honest <span class="codekeywords">type</span> that lets you

    This makes the possibility of <span class="seleniumError">not getting</span>

    Suppose that you want to train a machine

    you call training data<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Now, the thing is that <span class="codekeywords">for</span> huge sets of

    bunch to your model at once due to
    limitations in computer memory<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    So, what you do is break up your whole

    which can fit into your computer<span class="unicode">’</span>s memory
    at once<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    You <span class="logic">then</span> <span class="onlyhex">feed</span> these batches <span class="one">one</span> by <span class="one">one</span> to

    When all the batches are fed exactly once

    Basically it is equivalent to showing your

        Adding momentum helps solve that <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

<span class="codekeywords">NOTE</span><span class="subdued">:</span> High momentum should always be accompanied by low <span class="interesting">learning</span> rate, <span class="logic">else</span> you will overshoot the global optimum<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The carbon isotope records from both

    The lithologies <span class="logic">and</span> low organic-carbon

    In other words, the <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>autoregressive

    Explanation<span class="subdued">:</span>
        You have an innermost monad (<span class="kashyap">usually</span>

        You <span class="logic">then</span> wrap monad transformers

    Most of the monads in the mtl library have

homonyms
    Words that share form <span class="logic">but</span> have unrelated,

synonyms
    Different words that have the same
    propositional meaning in some <span class="logic">or</span> all
    contexts<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    However, there <span class="five">may</span> be <span class="seleniumError">no examples of</span>
    perfect synonymy since even <span class="logic">if</span>
    propositional meaning is identical, they
    <span class="five">may</span> vary in notions of politeness <span class="logic">or</span> other
    usages <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="googlered">so</span> <span class="serviceAdd">on</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Examples<span class="subdued">:</span>

        kind of a large sister to Benjamin
        (<span class="seleniumError">Not as</span> <span class="toby">acceptable)</span>

      The latter works less because <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>big<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> has
      multiple senses, <span class="one">one</span> of which does <span class="seleniumError">not</span>
      correspond to <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>large<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>.

antonyms
    Senses which are opposite <span class="codekeywords">with</span> respect to

hyponym
    <span class="one">One</span> sense is a hyponym of another <span class="logic">if</span> the

locus
loci (plural)
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span><span class="ircroom">#genetics</span><span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    <span class="textdone">A fixed</span> position on a chromosome, like the
    position of a gene <span class="logic">or</span> a marker (<span class="kashyap">genetic</span>
    marker).

    Example<span class="subdued">:</span>
        Each chromosome carries many genes<span class="discrete">;</span>
        human<span class="quote">'</span>s estimated <span class="quote">'</span>haploid<span class="quote">'</span> protein

F-<span class="math">algebra</span>
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span><span class="ircroom">#category</span> theory<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    F-algebras generalize algebraic structure<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Rewriting the algebraic laws in terms of
    morphisms eliminates all references to
    quantified elements from the axioms, <span class="logic">and</span>
    these algebraic laws <span class="five">may</span> <span class="logic">then</span> be glued
    together in terms of a single functor F,
    the signature<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    F-algebras can also be used to represent
    data structures used in programming, such
    as lists <span class="logic">and</span> trees<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

catamorphism
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span><span class="ircroom">#category</span> theory<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    Deconstructs a data structure <span class="codekeywords">with</span> an
    F-<span class="math">algebra</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> its underlying functor<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A catamorphism <span class="codekeywords">for</span> some F-<span class="math">algebra</span> (<span class="one">X</span>,<span class="six">f)</span> is
    denoted (<span class="brightoperator3">|</span> <span class="six">f</span> <span class="brightoperator3">|</span>)F<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    When the functor F can be determined
    unambiguously, it is usually written (<span class="brightoperator3">|</span><span class="unicode">φ</span><span class="brightoperator3">|</span>)
    <span class="logic">or</span> cata <span class="unicode">φ</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Due to this choice of notation, a
    catamorphism is sometimes called a banana
    <span class="logic">and</span> the (<span class="brightoperator3">|</span>.<span class="brightoperator3">|</span>) notation is sometimes
    referred to as banana brackets<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Examples<span class="subdued">:</span>
        <span class="gitbranch">$</span><span class="discrete">MYGIT/</span>acmeism<span class="discrete">/</span>RosettaCodeData<span class="discrete">/</span>Task<span class="discrete">/</span>Catamorphism<span class="discrete">/</span>C++/catamorphism<span class="textpath">.cpp</span>

    The unique homomorphism from an initial
    <span class="math">algebra</span> into some other <span class="math">algebra</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In <span class="allcaps">FP</span>, catamorphisms provide
    generalizations of folds of lists to
    arbitrary algebraic data types, which can
    be described as initial algebras<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The dual concept is that of anamorphism
    that generalize unfolds<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A hylomorphism is the composition of an
    anamorphism followed by a catamorphism<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

existential types

    It<span class="quote">'</span>s really rather beautiful as a way to

    The general approach is that you <span class="seleniumError">don't</span>

    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> omit values from the tuple syntax,
      unifying the standard tuple sugar <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
      the tuple constructor syntax to form <span class="one">one</span>
      generalized syntax <span class="codekeywords">for</span> tuples<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Normally, tuples are constructed <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the
    standard tuple sugar, which looks like
    this<span class="subdued">:</span>

        (<span class="one">1</span>, <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>hello<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>, <span class="six">6</span><span class="numberpunctuation">.</span><span class="five">5</span>, Just (), <span class="morediscrete">[</span><span class="five">5</span>, <span class="five">5</span>, <span class="six">6</span>, <span class="seven">7</span><span class="morediscrete">]</span>)

    This could be considered shorthand <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the
    following <span class="codekeywords">explicit</span> tuple constructor use<span class="subdued">:</span>

        (,,,,) <span class="one">1</span> <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>hello<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> <span class="six">6</span><span class="numberpunctuation">.</span><span class="five">5</span> (Just ()) <span class="morediscrete">[</span><span class="five">5</span>, <span class="five">5</span>, <span class="six">6</span>, <span class="seven">7</span><span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    However, the <span class="codekeywords">explicit</span> tuple constructor
    (,,,,) could just as easily be considered
    section sugar <span class="codekeywords">for</span> tuples, expanding to<span class="subdued">:</span>

        <span class="morediscrete">\v</span> w <span class="one">x</span> <span class="two">y</span> <span class="three">z</span> -&gt; (v, w, <span class="one">x</span>, <span class="two">y</span>, <span class="three">z</span>)

    Looking at it <span class="highpriority">this way</span> allows us to ask,
    <span class="unicode">“</span>Why can<span class="unicode">’</span>t we partially section a tuple<span class="brightoperator2">?</span>

        data C = C {a <span class="subdued">::</span> Int}

    Provides an abstract representation of

    language it was written in<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Most parsers are difficult to reuse
    because they<span class="quote">'</span>re coupled to the language<span class="unicode">’</span>s
    implementation<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">With</span> tree-sitter, you <span class="seleniumError">don't have</span> to write
    a lot of complicated code to parse a
    language<span class="discrete">;</span> you just write the grammar<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

parsing
    <span class="logic">While</span> the goal is to emulate valid syntax,
    certain use-cases <span class="highpriority">require</span> supporting
    <span class="generalError">invalid syntax</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    There is a difference between parsing
    verses interpreting <span class="logic">or</span> compiling a
    language<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Your parse tree <span class="seleniumError">doesn't always</span> represent
    code that will run, <span class="logic">but</span> it has to be
    <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>valid enough<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> to represent readable code<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Example
        The Java language requires statements
        (<span class="kashyap">such</span> as the expression <span class="buildfiles">`</span><span class="one">x</span> = <span class="three">3</span><span class="buildfiles">`</span>) to be
        inside of methods<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        However, in the <span class="buildfiles">`</span>tree-sitter-java<span class="buildfiles">`</span>
        grammar, we explicitly <span class="safe">allow</span>
        statements to be parsed outside of
        methods<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        The grammar was loosened <span class="googlered">so</span> that
        syntax highlighting <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a code snippet
        of Java in a markdown file <span class="five">may</span> be
        supported<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        <span class="logic">While</span> this code <span class="seleniumError">wouldn't compile</span>, it
        <span class="seleniumError">doesn't break</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the use-cases that

    hierarchical softmax <span class="logic">and</span><span class="discrete">/</span><span class="logic">or</span> negative

    <span class="codekeywords">To</span> approximate the conditional <span class="logcode">log</span>-

<span class="awesome">query</span> execution plan
    An ordered set of steps used to access

    This is a specific <span class="logic">case</span> of the relational
    model concept of access plans<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Since <span class="allcaps">SQL</span> is declarative, there are

    Because <span class="awesome">query</span> optimizers are imperfect,

    We want to have a linter that catches many

    <span class="logic">And</span> the harm from saying the <span class="seleniumError">wrong</span> thing

    Thus our score metric is defined as

        T (T / (F + T))<span class="gitbranch">^</span>k,

    <span class="codekeywords">where</span> T is the number of <span class="safe">true</span> positives

    classical states we measure come from
    <span class="interesting">probabilistic</span> quantum states progressively
    (<span class="kashyap">although</span> very quickly) losing their
    coherence as they become ever more
    entangled <span class="codekeywords">with</span> their environment<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Quantum Darwinism, put forward by Wojciech
    Zurek of Los Alamos National Laboratory in
    <span class="new">New Mexico</span>, argues that the classical
    states we perceive are robust quantum
    states that can survive entanglement
    during decoherence<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    His theoretical framework posits that the
    information about these states will be
    duplicated many times <span class="logic">and</span> disseminated
    throughout the environment<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Just as natural selection tells us that
    the <span class="tests">fittest</span> individuals in a species <span class="highpriority">must</span>
    survive to reproduce in great numbers <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="googlered">so</span> go on to shape evolution, the <span class="tests">fittest</span>
    quantum states will be copied <span class="logic">and</span> appear
    classical<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This redundancy means that many individual
    observers will measure <span class="safe">any given</span> state as
    having the same value, <span class="googlered">so</span> ensuring
    objective reality<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Semilattice

    A magma <span class="codekeywords">where</span> the operation is
    commutative, associative, <span class="logic">and</span> idempotent<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It could refer to either of the abelian
    semigroups of a lattice, written <span class="unicode">∨</span> <span class="logic">and</span>
    often called join <span class="logic">or</span> Boolean <span class="logic">or</span>, <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="unicode">∧</span>
    often called meet <span class="logic">or</span> Boolean <span class="logic">and</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    We <span class="codekeywords">define</span> the term here <span class="codekeywords">for</span> reasons
    related to its usage in Haskell, <span class="logic">but</span> it is
    best understood in context of lattices,

    The last pair of laws is called
    absorption<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Since absorption laws are unique to
    lattices, we discuss them here <span class="highpriority">instead</span> of
    in the glossary<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The absorption laws link a pair of
    semilattices in a kind of distributive
    relationship, <span class="googlered">so</span> that a lattice <span class="failing">is not</span>
    just <span class="safe">any two</span> semilattices that happen to
    be over the same set, <span class="logic">but</span> only
    semilattices that are linked in <span class="highpriority">this way</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In particular, the absorption laws ensure
    that the <span class="two">two</span> semilattices are dual of each
    other<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It can take a moment to see what it means,
    <span class="googlered">so</span> let<span class="unicode">’</span>s <span class="stopped">pause</span> <span class="logic">and</span> look at concrete

        <span class="safe">True</span>

    Positive integers form a lattice under the
    operations min <span class="logic">and</span> max, <span class="logic">and</span> we can see the

    The absorption laws are sometimes called a

    related to idempotence in that the

    <span class="allcaps">SVM</span> can also be used as a <span class="failing">regression</span>
    method, maintaining all the main
    features that characterize the algorithm
    (<span class="kashyap">maximal</span> margin).

    <span class="allcaps">SVR</span> uses the same principles as the <span class="allcaps">SVM</span>
    <span class="codekeywords">for</span> <span class="interesting">classification</span>, <span class="codekeywords">with</span> only a few minor
    differences<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    First of all, because output is a real
    number it becomes very difficult to
    predict the information at hand, which has
    infinite possibilities<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In the <span class="logic">case</span> of <span class="failing">regression</span>, a margin

    <span class="logic">But</span> besides this fact, there is also a
    more complicated reason, the

    However, the main idea is always the same<span class="subdued">:</span>
    to minimize <span class="seleniumError">error</span>, individualizing
    the hyperplane which maximizes the margin,
    keeping in mind that part of the
    <span class="seleniumError">error</span> is tolerated<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

particle horizon
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>cosmological horizon<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    The maximum distance from which light from
    particles could have traveled to the
    observer in the age of the universe<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It represents the boundary between the
    observable <span class="logic">and</span> the unobservable regions of
    the universe, <span class="googlered">so</span> its distance at the
    present epoch defines the size of the
    observable universe<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

hubble horizon
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>cosmological horizon<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    A conceptual horizon defining the boundary
    between particles that are moving slower
    <span class="logic">and</span> faster than the speed of light
    relative to an observer at <span class="one">one</span> given time<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="highpriority">Note</span> that this does <span class="seleniumError">not mean</span> the particle
    is unobservable, the light from the past
    is reaching <span class="logic">and</span> will <span class="safe">continue</span> to reach the
    observer <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a <span class="logic">while</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Also, more <span class="highpriority">important</span>ly, in the current
    expansion model e.g., light emitted from
    the Hubble radius will reach us in a
    finite amount of time<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It is a common misconception that light
    from the Hubble radius can never reach us<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It is <span class="safe">true</span> that particles on the Hubble
    radius recede from us <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the speed of
    light, <span class="logic">but</span> the Hubble radius gets larger
    over time (<span class="kashyap">because</span> the Hubble parameter H
    gets smaller over time), <span class="googlered">so</span> light emitted
    towards us from a particle on the Hubble
    radius will be inside the Hubble radius
    some time later<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Only light emitted from the cosmic event
    horizon <span class="logic">or</span> further will never reach us in
    a finite amount of time<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

event horizon
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>cosmological horizon<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    Differs from the particle horizon in that
    the particle horizon represents the
    largest comoving distance from which light
    could have reached the observer by a
    specific time, <span class="logic">while</span> the event horizon is
    the largest comoving distance from which
    light emitted now can ever reach the
    observer in the future<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

future horizon
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>cosmological horizon<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    In an accelerating universe, there are
    events which will be unobservable as <span class="toby">t</span>
    approaches <span class="unicode">∞</span> as signals from future events
    become redshifted to arbitrarily long
    wavelengths in the exponentially expanding
    de Sitter space<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This sets a limit on the farthest distance
    that we can possibly see as measured in
    units of proper distance today<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">Or</span>, more precisely, there are events that
    are spatially separated <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a certain
    frame of reference happening
    simultaneously <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the event occurring
    right now <span class="codekeywords">for</span> which <span class="seleniumError">no signal will</span> ever
    reach us, even though we can observe
    events that occurred at the same location
    in space that happened in the distant
    past<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">While</span> we will <span class="safe">continue</span> to receive signals
    from this location in space, even <span class="logic">if</span> we
    wait an infinite amount of time, a signal
    that left from that location today will
    never reach us<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Additionally, the signals coming from that
    location will have less <span class="logic">and</span> less energy
    <span class="logic">and</span> be less <span class="logic">and</span> less frequent until the
    location, <span class="codekeywords">for</span> all practical purposes,
    becomes unobservable<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In a universe that is dominated by dark
    energy which is undergoing an exponential
    expansion of the scale factor, all objects
    that are gravitationally unbound <span class="codekeywords">with</span>

    How it works

    Cycle of <span class="three">3</span> steps<span class="subdued">:</span>

        <span class="two">2</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>  Annealing
        <span class="three">3</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>  Extension

        H-bonds reform <span class="logic">and</span> the cycle repeats<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Each cycle doubles the amount of <span class="allcaps">DNA</span>
    present in the sample<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Each step is conveniently triggered by
    temperature<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Temperature regulation enables the
    ingredients <span class="codekeywords">for</span> all steps to be mixed in
    the same container<span class="morediscrete">.</span> All the researchers
    <span class="highpriority">need</span> do is mix up the recipe<span class="morediscrete">.</span> The raising
    <span class="logic">and</span> lowering of the temperature does the
    <span class="api">rest</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Denaturing
        H-bonds break<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        The temperature is raised to
        approximately <span class="four">94</span><span class="unicode">°</span>F<span class="morediscrete">.</span> The heat breaks
        the hydrogen bonds between the amino

    Annealing
        Primers stick to strand<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        The temperature is lowered to about
        <span class="eight">58</span><span class="unicode">°</span>F <span class="logic">and</span> allows the primers to attach<span class="morediscrete">.</span>
        The primers attach to the singular
        strands of the sample by reforming

        The primers enable the attachment of
        the <span class="allcaps">DNA</span> polymerase during extension<span class="morediscrete">.</span>
        The polymerase <span class="highpriority">must</span> have a segment of
        intact <span class="allcaps">DNA</span> on the complementary strand
        to begin the process of attaching base
        pairs <span class="logic">and</span> reforming <span class="logic">or</span> copying the
        strand<span class="morediscrete">.</span> Since the <span class="allcaps">DNA</span> polymerase can
        only copy in <span class="one">one</span> direction along the
        strand, the primers can be selectively

    Extension
        Polymerase base pairing<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        As the polymerase attaches nucleotides

    The plasma membrane is described to be
    fluid because of its hydrophobic integral
    components such as lipids <span class="logic">and</span> membrane
    proteins that move laterally <span class="logic">or</span> sideways
    throughout the membrane<span class="morediscrete">.</span> That means the
    membrane <span class="failing">is not</span> solid, <span class="logic">but</span> more like a
    <span class="quote">'</span>fluid<span class="quote">'</span>.

    The membrane is depicted as mosaic because
    like a mosaic that is made up of many
    different parts the plasma membrane is
    composed of different kinds of
    macromolecules, such as integral proteins,
    peripheral proteins, glycoproteins,
    phospholipids, glycolipids, <span class="logic">and</span> in some
    cases cholesterol, lipoproteins<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    According to the model, the plasma
    membrane is a lipid bilayer (<span class="kashyap">interspersed</span>
    <span class="codekeywords">with</span> proteins). It is <span class="googlered">so</span> because of its

        When cis,
            The effect of this is that, in
            restricted environments, such as

            <span class="logic">or</span> <span class="allcaps">TAG</span> in lipid droplets, cis

Chelate
    Chelation describes a particular way that
    ions <span class="logic">and</span> molecules bind metal ions<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In biochemistry <span class="logic">and</span> molecular biology, a

Torr
    The torr (symbol<span class="subdued">:</span> Torr) is a traditional

    Historically, <span class="one">one</span> torr was intended to be

    However, subsequent redefinitions of the

    <span class="logic">but</span> it is often combined <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the metric

Cooperativity
Co-operativity
Cooperative binding
    A phenomenon displayed by systems
    involving identical <span class="logic">or</span> near-identical
    elements, which act non-independently of
    each other, relative to a hypothetical
    standard non-interacting system in which
    the individual elements are acting
    independently<span class="morediscrete">.</span> <span class="one">One</span> manifestation of this
    are enzymes <span class="logic">or</span> receptors that have
    multiple binding sites <span class="codekeywords">where</span> the affinity
    of the binding sites <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a ligand is
    apparently increased (<span class="kashyap">positive</span>
    cooperativity) <span class="logic">or</span> decreased (<span class="kashyap">negative</span>
    cooperativity) upon the binding of a
    ligand to a binding site<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="unicode">∴</span> the affinity of Hb<span class="quote">'</span>s <span class="four">4</span> binding sites <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
    <span class="allcaps">O</span><span class="unicode">₂</span> increases above that of the unbound

    In haemoglobin<span class="subdued">:</span>

        Switching state in <span class="one">one</span> globin unit
        makes all the other globins have that

        <span class="logic">Therefore</span>, the tetramer has overall R
        <span class="logic">and</span> T states<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        Thus, in the lungs <span class="allcaps">O</span><span class="unicode">₂</span> uptake favours
        more <span class="allcaps">O</span><span class="unicode">₂</span> uptake, <span class="logic">and</span> in the tissues the

    when <span class="interesting">classifying</span> in <span class="interesting">predictive</span> analytics<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This is because a simple model <span class="five">may</span> have a
    high level of accuracy <span class="logic">but</span> be too crude to
    be useful<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span>, <span class="logic">if</span> the incidence of category
    A is dominant, being found in <span class="nine">99</span><span class="subdued">%</span> of

    Precision <span class="logic">and</span> recall are better measures
    in such cases<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The underlying issue is that there is a

    <span class="logic">and</span> the negative <span class="codekeywords">class</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Precision <span class="logic">and</span> recall help, <span class="logic">but</span> precision

early stopping
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span><span class="ircroom">#ml</span><span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    A form of regularization used to avoid

    an iterative method, such as <span class="toby">GD.</span>

    Such methods update the learner <span class="googlered">so</span> as <span class="toby">to</span>
    make it better fit the training data <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
    each iteration<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Up to a point, this improves the learner<span class="quote">'</span>s
    performance on data outside of the

    Past that point, however, improving the
    learner<span class="quote">'</span>s fit to the training data comes
    at the expense of increased generalization
    <span class="seleniumError">error</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Early stopping rules provide guidance as

    When in comes to <span class="allcaps">RNNs</span>, the tensors usually
    go to rank <span class="three">3</span>+, <span class="logic">but</span> the idea stays the
    same<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">If</span> the input is (batch_size, sequence_num,
    features), it<span class="quote">'</span>s called batch major,
    because the <span class="zero">0</span> axis is the batch_size<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">If</span> the input is (sequence_num, batch_size,

    The features is always the last dimension

    Depending on the network structure, it
    might expect specifically the batch <span class="logic">or</span> the
    time as the <span class="zero">0</span> axis, <span class="googlered">so</span> the format of input
    data matters<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">And</span> depending on the previous layers, <span class="one">one</span>
    can get either of the those

    So the conversion from <span class="one">one</span> arrangement to
    another might be required, either by the
    library <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> <span class="logic">or</span> by the caller<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    As far as I can <span class="highpriority">remember</span>, batch major is

Core Categorical Feature Concepts
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> Vocabulary
      The set of possible values <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a
      categorical feature<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

      It<span class="quote">'</span>s used to train the embeddings <span class="logic">or</span>
      create the hash buckets <span class="codekeywords">for</span> categorical
      features<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> Hash buckets
      The simplest way to map <span class="whiteonblack">categorical</span>
      features is just to hash their values,
      possibly into a set of buckets, whose
      number is determined <span class="logic">or</span> a hyperparameter<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> <span class="one">One</span> hot encoding
      Given a categorical input feature, <span class="logic">if</span> we
      simply map <span class="whiteonblack">the</span> possible values to
      numbers (<span class="kashyap">say</span> red-<span class="discrete">&gt;</span><span class="one">1</span>, <span class="blue">blue</span>-<span class="discrete">&gt;</span><span class="two">2</span>, green-<span class="discrete">&gt;</span><span class="three">3</span>)
      we are putting red <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="blue">blue</span> closer in
      meaning (<span class="two">2</span><span class="numberpunctuation">-</span><span class="one">1</span>=<span class="one">1</span>), even <span class="logic">if</span> they <span class="seleniumError">aren't any</span>

      (<span class="three">3</span><span class="numberpunctuation">-</span><span class="one">1</span>=<span class="two">2</span>).

      <span class="highpriority">Instead</span>, a <span class="one">one</span> hot encoding feature column
      would create <span class="three">3</span> separate nodes <span class="codekeywords">for</span> red,

      the actual value be <span class="zero">0</span>, <span class="logic">and</span> the actual
      value <span class="one">1</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

      <span class="highpriority">This way</span> red is <span class="seleniumError">no closer to</span> <span class="blue">blue</span> than

    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> Softmax
      Like a sigmoid <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span>, <span class="logic">but</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> multiple

      values to a set of <span class="interesting">probabilities</span> that sum

      <span class="interesting">probability</span> of the input <span class="awesome">example</span> being a

      A very common pattern is <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the final

      training those vectors<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

      See the wor<span class="two">d2vec</span> tutorial here<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

      It provides more <span class="interesting">semantic</span>s than just a
      <span class="one">one</span>-hot encoding since similar input
      features will have more similar values<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

      <span class="highpriority">Instead</span> of a node <span class="codekeywords">for</span> every possible value
      of the category, you use <span class="textdone">a fixed</span> size
      <span class="codekeywords">vector</span> (depth).

      <span class="one">One</span> <span class="highpriority">interesting</span> side-effect of this

    Let<span class="unicode">’</span>s roll back a bit to understand the

        We are now familiar <span class="codekeywords">with</span> <span class="allcaps">RNN</span><span class="unicode">’</span>s
        shortcoming is that it <span class="failing">is not</span> well

        themselves<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        <span class="codekeywords">To</span> handle this flaw, the Transformer
        just allows the encoder <span class="logic">and</span> decoder to
        see the entire input sequence all at
        once, directly modelling these
        dependencies using self-attention<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        This fundamental idea of transformer

    Coined the term <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span><span class="interesting">artificial intelligence</span><span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>
    (<span class="interesting">AI</span>).

    Developed the Lisp programming language
    family<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Significantly influenced the
    design of the <span class="allcaps">ALGOL</span> programming language<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Popularized timesharing<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Very influential in the early development
    of <span class="interesting">AI</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="five">May</span> he <span class="api">rest</span> in peace, designed a language
    that is as <span class="sshError">close</span> to perfection as a human
    can hope to achieve<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

tail call
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>subroutine call<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    Performed as the final action of a
    procedure<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">If</span> a tail call might lead to the same
    subroutine being called again later in the
    call chain, the subroutine is said to be
    tail-recursive, which is a special <span class="logic">case</span> of
    recursion<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Tail recursion (<span class="toby">or</span> tail-end recursion) is
    particularly useful, <span class="logic">and</span> often easy to
    handle in implementations<span class="morediscrete">.</span>


Tail Call Optimization
    Tail calls can be implemented without
    adding a <span class="new">new stack</span> frame to the call
    stack<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Most of the frame of the current procedure
    is <span class="seleniumError">no longer needed</span>, <span class="logic">and</span> can be replaced
    by the frame of the tail call, <span class="textunderlinemod">modified</span> as
    appropriate (<span class="kashyap">similar</span> to overlay <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
    processes, <span class="logic">but</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> calls).

    The program can <span class="logic">then</span> jump to the called
    subroutine<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Producing such code <span class="highpriority">instead</span> of a standard
    call sequence is called tail call
    elimination<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Tail call elimination

    allows procedure calls in tail position to
    be implemented as efficiently as <span class="toby">goto</span>
    statements, thus allowing efficient
    structured programming<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In the words of Guy L<span class="morediscrete">.</span> Steele, <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>in
    general, procedure calls <span class="five">may</span> be usefully
    thought of as <span class="allcaps">GOTO</span> statements which also
    <span class="codekeywords">pass</span> parameters, <span class="logic">and</span> can be uniformly
    coded as <span class="morediscrete">[</span>machine code<span class="morediscrete">]</span> <span class="allcaps">JUMP</span>
    instructions.<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>

    <span class="seleniumError">Not all</span> programming languages <span class="highpriority">require</span> tail
    call elimination<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    However, in functional programming
    languages, tail call elimination is often
    guaranteed by the language standard,
    allowing tail recursion to use a similar
    amount of memory as an equivalent loop<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The special <span class="logic">case</span> of tail recursive calls,
    when a <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> calls itself, <span class="five">may</span> be more
    amenable to call elimination than general
    tail calls<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    When the language <span class="interesting">semantic</span>s do <span class="seleniumError">not</span>
    explicitly support general tail calls, a
    compiler can often still optimize sibling
    calls, <span class="logic">or</span> tail calls to functions which
    take <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="safe">return</span> the same types as <span class="toby">the</span>
    caller<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

<span class="three">third</span>-generation programming language
<span class="three">3GL</span>
    A generational way to categorize
    high-level computer programming

    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> C++
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> C#
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> Java
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> JavaScript

    Some advanced <span class="three">3GLs</span> like Python, Ruby, <span class="logic">and</span>
    Perl combine some <span class="four">4GL</span> abilities within a
    general-purpose <span class="three">3GL</span> environment<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Also, libraries <span class="codekeywords">with</span> <span class="four">4GL</span>-like features
    have been developed as add-ons <span class="codekeywords">for</span> most
    popular <span class="three">3GLs</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This has blurred the distinction of <span class="four">4GL</span>
    <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="three">3GL</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>


fourth-generation programming language
<span class="four">4GL</span>
    <span class="safe">Any computer</span> programming language that
    belongs to a <span class="codekeywords">class</span> of languages envisioned
    as an advancement upon <span class="three">3GLs</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Each of the programming language
    generations aims to provide a higher level
    of abstraction of the internal computer
    hardware details, making the language more
    programmer-friendly, powerful, <span class="logic">and</span>
    versatile<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">While</span> the definition of <span class="four">4GL</span> has changed
    over time, it can be typified by operating
    more <span class="codekeywords">with</span> large collections of information
    at once rather than focusing on just bits
    <span class="logic">and</span> bytes<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Languages claimed to be <span class="four">4GL</span> <span class="five">may</span> <span class="codekeywords">include</span>
    support <span class="codekeywords">for</span> database management, report
    generation, mathematical optimization, <span class="allcaps">GUI</span>
    development, <span class="logic">or</span> web development<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Some researchers state that <span class="four">4GLs</span> are a
    subset of domain-specific languages<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The concept of <span class="four">4GL</span> was developed from the
    <span class="zero">1970s</span> through the <span class="zero">1990s</span>, overlapping most
    of the development of <span class="three">3GL</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

<span class="five">5GL</span>
    <span class="safe">Any programming</span> language based on <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span>
    solving using constraints given to the
    program, rather than using an algorithm
    written by a programmer<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Most constraint-based <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="logcode">logic</span>
    programming languages <span class="logic">and</span> some other
    declarative languages are fifth-generation
    languages<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

attribute grammar
    A formal way to <span class="codekeywords">define</span> attributes <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the
    productions of a formal grammar,
    associating these attributes <span class="codekeywords">with</span> values<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The evaluation occurs in the nodes of the
    abstract syntax tree, when the language is
    processed by some parser <span class="logic">or</span> compiler<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The attributes are divided into <span class="two">two</span>
    groups<span class="subdued">:</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> synthesized attributes, <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> inherited attributes<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The synthesized attributes are the result
    of the attribute evaluation rules, <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="five">may</span>
    also use the values of the inherited
    attributes<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The inherited attributes are <span class="success">passed</span> down
    from parent nodes<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In some approaches, synthesized attributes
    are used to <span class="codekeywords">pass</span> <span class="interesting">semantic</span> information up
    the parse tree, <span class="logic">while</span> inherited attributes
    help <span class="codekeywords">pass</span> <span class="interesting">semantic</span> information down <span class="logic">and</span>
    across it<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> instance, when constructing a language
    translation tool, such as a compiler, it
    <span class="five">may</span> be used to assign <span class="interesting">semantic</span> values to
    syntax constructions<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Also, it is possible to validate <span class="interesting">semantic</span>
    checks associated <span class="codekeywords">with</span> a grammar,
    representing the rules of a language <span class="seleniumError">not</span>
    explicitly imparted by the syntax
    definition<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Attribute grammars can also be used to
    translate the syntax tree directly into
    code <span class="codekeywords">for</span> some specific machine, <span class="logic">or</span> into
    some intermediate language<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="one">One</span> strength of attribute grammars is that
    they can transport information from
    anywhere in the abstract syntax tree to
    anywhere <span class="logic">else</span>, in a controlled <span class="logic">and</span> formal
    way<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A linear approach to modeling the
    relationship between a scalar response <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="one">one</span> <span class="logic">or</span> more explanatory variables<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The relationships are modeled using linear
    <span class="interesting">predictor</span> functions whose <span class="sshError">unknown</span> model
    parameters are estimated from the data<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Such models are called linear models<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    linear <span class="failing">regression</span>

    Most commonly, the conditional mean of the
    response given the values of the
    explanatory variables (<span class="toby">or</span> <span class="interesting">predictors</span>) is
    assumed to be an affine <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> of those
    values<span class="discrete">;</span> less commonly, the conditional
    median <span class="logic">or</span> some other quantile is used<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

<span class="logic">If</span> the goal is <span class="interesting">prediction</span>, <span class="logic">or</span> forecasting,
<span class="logic">or</span> <span class="seleniumError">error</span> reduction, linear <span class="failing">regression</span> can
be used to fit a <span class="interesting">predictive</span> model to an
observed data set of values of the
response <span class="logic">and</span> explanatory variables<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

After developing such a model, <span class="logic">if</span>
additional values of the explanatory
variables are collected without an
accompanying response value, the fitted
model can be used to make a <span class="interesting">prediction</span> of
the response<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

<span class="logic">If</span> the goal is to explain variation in the
response <span class="variable">variable</span> that can be attributed
to variation in the explanatory variables,
linear <span class="failing">regression</span> analysis can be applied
to quantify the strength of the
relationship between the response <span class="logic">and</span> the
explanatory variables, <span class="logic">and</span> in particular
to determine whether some explanatory
variables <span class="five">may</span> have <span class="seleniumError">no linear relationship</span>
<span class="codekeywords">with</span> the response at all, <span class="logic">or</span> to identify
which subsets of explanatory variables <span class="five">may</span>
contain redundant information about the
response<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Linear <span class="failing">regression</span> models are often fitted
using the least squares approach, <span class="logic">but</span> they
<span class="five">may</span> also be fitted in other ways, such as
by minimizing the <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>lack of fit<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> in some
other norm (<span class="kashyap">as</span> <span class="codekeywords">with</span> least absolute
deviations <span class="failing">regression</span>), <span class="logic">or</span> by minimizing a
penalized version of the least squares
cost <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> as in ridge <span class="failing">regression</span>
(<span class="allcaps">L</span><span class="two">2</span>-norm penalty) <span class="logic">and</span> lasso (<span class="allcaps">L</span><span class="one">1</span>-norm
penalty).

Conversely, the least squares approach can
be used to fit models that are <span class="seleniumError">not linear</span>
models<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Thus, although the terms <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>least squares<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>
<span class="logic">and</span> <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>linear model<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> are closely linked,
they are <span class="seleniumError">not synonymous</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">and</span> has been used to describe nonlinear
    phenomena such as the growth rate of

    isotopes in lake sediments, <span class="logic">and</span> the

    Although polynomial <span class="failing">regression</span> fits a
    nonlinear model to the data, as <span class="toby">a</span>
    statistical estimation <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span> it is

    The explanatory (independent) variables

    A <span class="new">new abstract</span> view of computation<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    They serve much the same purpose as
    monads <span class="Special">--</span> providing a common structure <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
    libraries <span class="Special">--</span> <span class="logic">but</span> are more general<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In particular they <span class="safe">allow</span> notions of
    computation that <span class="five">may</span> be partially static
    (<span class="kashyap">independent</span> of the input) <span class="logic">or</span> <span class="five">may</span> take
    multiple inputs<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">If</span> your application works fine <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
    monads, you might as well stick <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
    them<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">But</span> <span class="logic">if</span> you<span class="quote">'</span>re using a structure that<span class="quote">'</span>s
    very like a monad, <span class="logic">but</span> <span class="seleniumError">isn't one</span>, maybe
    it<span class="quote">'</span>s an arrow<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

monad vs arrow
    <span class="highpriority">Most important</span>ly<span class="subdued">:</span>
        There are more things which are arrows
        than there are things which are
        monads<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Monads are strictly more powerful than
    arrows<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Monad
        Is an arrow equipped <span class="codekeywords">with</span> an apply
        <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> of <span class="codekeywords">type</span>

            (<span class="kashyap">a</span> <span class="tilde">~</span><span class="discrete">&gt;</span> b, <span class="one">a)</span> <span class="tilde">~</span><span class="discrete">&gt;</span> b

        <span class="codekeywords">where</span> (<span class="tilde">~</span><span class="discrete">&gt;</span>) is the constructor <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a
        given arrow<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        This destroys the meticulous
        distinction arrows maintain between
        terms <span class="logic">and</span> commands (<span class="logic">or</span>, <span class="logic">if</span> you prefer,
        objects <span class="logic">and</span> morphisms).

monad
    Provide a powerful way to build
    computations <span class="codekeywords">with</span> effects<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Each of the standard monads is specialised
    to do exactly <span class="one">one</span> thing<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In real code, we often <span class="highpriority">need</span> to be able to
    use several effects at once<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

monad transformer

    Explanation<span class="subdued">:</span>
        You have an innermost monad (<span class="kashyap">usually</span>
        Identity <span class="logic">or</span> <span class="allcaps">IO</span> <span class="logic">but</span> you can use <span class="safe">any</span>
        monad).

        You <span class="logic">then</span> wrap monad transformers
        around this monad to make bigger,
        better monads<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Similar to a regular monad, <span class="logic">but</span> it<span class="quote">'</span>s <span class="seleniumError">not a</span>
    standalone entity<span class="subdued">:</span> <span class="highpriority">instead</span>, it modifies
    the behaviour of an underlying monad<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Most of the monads in the mtl library have
    transformer equivalents<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    By convention, the transformer version of
    a monad has the same name, <span class="codekeywords">with</span> a T stuck
    on the end<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span>, the transformer equivalent of
    State is StateT<span class="discrete">;</span> it adds mutable state to
    an underlying monad<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The WriterT monad transformer makes it
    possible to write data when stacked on top
    of another monad<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Continuous Bag of Words approach
    Word embeddings <span class="codekeywords">for</span> each word in the
    sentence are aggregated to represent the
    entire sentence as a single <span class="codekeywords">vector</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

beta reduction
<span class="unicode">β</span> reduction
    The process of calculating a result from
    the application of a <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> to an

        to the value <span class="seven">7</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        <span class="codekeywords">To</span> calculate the result, we substitute
        <span class="seven">7</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> every occurrence of <span class="one">x</span>, <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="googlered">so</span>
        the application of the <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span>

        (<span class="morediscrete">\x</span> -&gt; <span class="two">2</span><span class="asteriskoperator">*</span><span class="one">x</span><span class="asteriskoperator">*</span><span class="one">x</span> + <span class="two">y</span>)(<span class="seven">7</span>)

    these algebraic laws <span class="five">may</span> <span class="logic">then</span> be glued

catamorphism

    A catamorphism <span class="codekeywords">for</span> some F-<span class="math">algebra</span> (<span class="one">X</span>,<span class="six">f)</span> is

    When the functor F can be determined

    <span class="logic">or</span> cata <span class="unicode">φ</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Due to this choice of notation, a
    catamorphism is sometimes called a banana

    In <span class="allcaps">FP</span>, catamorphisms provide

    Rather mysterious<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="importantHardware">Starting</span> out as a Haskell newbie you see

    Their Haddock pages are pretty opaque <span class="logic">and</span>

    Here<span class="quote">'</span>s a quick rundown I thought I<span class="quote">'</span>d write

    It<span class="quote">'</span>s really rather beautiful as a way to
    do generic programming in Haskell<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The general approach is that you <span class="seleniumError">don't</span>
    know what data types are being given to
    you, <span class="logic">but</span> you want to work upon them almost
    as <span class="logic">if</span> you did<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Most parsers are difficult to reuse

parsing
    <span class="logic">While</span> the goal is to emulate valid syntax,
    certain use-cases <span class="highpriority">require</span> supporting
    <span class="generalError">invalid syntax</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    There is a difference between parsing
    verses interpreting <span class="logic">or</span> compiling a
    language<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Your parse tree <span class="seleniumError">doesn't always</span> represent
    code that will run, <span class="logic">but</span> it has to be
    <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>valid enough<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> to represent readable code<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Example
        The Java language requires statements
        (<span class="kashyap">such</span> as the expression <span class="buildfiles">`</span><span class="one">x</span> = <span class="three">3</span><span class="buildfiles">`</span>) to be
        inside of methods<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        However, in the <span class="buildfiles">`</span>tree-sitter-java<span class="buildfiles">`</span>
        grammar, we explicitly <span class="safe">allow</span>
        statements to be parsed outside of
        methods<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        The grammar was loosened <span class="googlered">so</span> that
        syntax highlighting <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a code snippet
        of Java in a markdown file <span class="five">may</span> be
        supported<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        <span class="logic">While</span> this code <span class="seleniumError">wouldn't compile</span>, it
        <span class="seleniumError">doesn't break</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the use-cases that

    Obtains a sequence of observations which
    are approximated from a specified

    This sequence can be used to<span class="subdued">:</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> approximate the joint distribution
      (e.g., to generate a histogram of the
      distribution)
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> approximate the marginal distribution of

    Typically, some of the variables

    As a result, care <span class="highpriority">must</span> be taken <span class="logic">if</span>
    independent samples are desired<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Generally, samples from the beginning of

    accurately represent the desired

    It has been shown, however, that using a
    longer chain <span class="highpriority">instead</span> (e.g<span class="morediscrete">.</span> a chain that is
    <span class="seleniumError">n</span> times as long as the initially

    Thus, thinning should only be applied when

Regular expressions

regular language
rational language
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>formal language<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    Can be expressed using a regular
    expression, in the strict sense of the
    latter notion used in theoretical computer

    <span class="highpriority">Alternatively</span>, a regular language can be

<span class="awesome">query</span> plan
<span class="awesome">query</span> execution plan
    An ordered set of steps used to access

    management system<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This is a specific <span class="logic">case</span> of the relational
    model concept of access plans<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Since <span class="allcaps">SQL</span> is declarative, there are
    typically a large number of alternative
    ways to execute a given <span class="awesome">query</span>, <span class="codekeywords">with</span> widely
    varying performance<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    When a <span class="awesome">query</span> is submitted to the database,

    executing the <span class="awesome">query</span> <span class="logic">and</span> returns what it
    considers the best option<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Because <span class="awesome">query</span> optimizers are imperfect,
    database users <span class="logic">and</span> administrators
    sometimes <span class="highpriority">need</span> to manually examine <span class="logic">and</span>

    Evaluate the linter<span class="quote">'</span>s performance<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    We want to have a linter that catches many
    <span class="seleniumError">errors</span>, <span class="logic">but</span> which takes <span class="seleniumError">false</span> alarms
    seriously<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Better to say nothing than to say the

    <span class="logic">And</span> the harm from saying the <span class="seleniumError">wrong</span> thing
    is greater than the benefit of having said
    the right thing<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Thus our score metric is defined as

        T (T / (F + T))<span class="gitbranch">^</span>k,

    <span class="codekeywords">where</span> T is the number of <span class="safe">true</span> positives
    (hits), F is the number of <span class="seleniumError">false</span> positives
    (<span class="kashyap">false</span> alarms), <span class="logic">and</span> k <span class="discrete">&gt;</span> <span class="zero">0</span> is a temperature
    parameter that determines the penalty <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
    imprecision<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In general, we choose as large a value of
    k as we can stomach, <span class="one">one</span> that strongly
    discourages the creation of rules that
    <span class="seleniumError">can't be</span> trusted<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Suppose that k = <span class="two">2</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">Then</span> <span class="logic">if</span> the linter detects <span class="zero">100</span> <span class="seleniumError">errors</span>, of

Quantum Darwinism
    In the past, physicists tended to view the
    classical <span class="logic">and</span> quantum worlds as <span class="toby">being</span>
    divided by an abrupt barrier that makes a
    fundamental distinction between the
    familiar macroscopic (classical) <span class="logic">and</span> the
    unfamiliar microscopic (quantum) realms<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">But</span> in recent decades that view has
    changed<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Many experts now think that the transition
    is gradual, <span class="logic">and</span> that the definite
    classical states we measure come from
    <span class="interesting">probabilistic</span> quantum states progressively
    (<span class="kashyap">although</span> very quickly) losing their
    coherence as they become ever more
    entangled <span class="codekeywords">with</span> their environment<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Quantum Darwinism, put forward by Wojciech
    Zurek of Los Alamos National Laboratory in
    <span class="new">New Mexico</span>, argues that the classical
    states we perceive are robust quantum
    states that can survive entanglement
    during decoherence<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    His theoretical framework posits that the
    information about these states will be
    duplicated many times <span class="logic">and</span> disseminated
    throughout the environment<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Just as natural selection tells us that
    the <span class="tests">fittest</span> individuals in a species <span class="highpriority">must</span>
    survive to reproduce in great numbers <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="googlered">so</span> go on to shape evolution, the <span class="tests">fittest</span>
    quantum states will be copied <span class="logic">and</span> appear
    classical<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This redundancy means that many individual
    observers will measure <span class="safe">any given</span> state as
    having the same value, <span class="googlered">so</span> ensuring
    objective reality<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Semiotics
semiotic studies
    The study of sign process (semiosis).

    It includes the study of signs <span class="logic">and</span> sign
    processes, indication, designation,
    likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy,
    metaphor, symbolism, signification, <span class="logic">and</span>
    communication<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It <span class="failing">is not</span> to be confused <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the
    Saussurean tradition called semiology,
    which is a subset of semiotics<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The semiotic tradition explores the study
    of signs <span class="logic">and</span> symbols as a significant part
    of communications<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Different from linguistics, semiotics also
    studies non-linguistic sign systems<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

monad transformer
    You have an innermost monad (<span class="kashyap">usually</span>
    Identity <span class="logic">or</span> <span class="allcaps">IO</span> <span class="logic">but</span> you can use <span class="safe">any monad</span>).

    You <span class="logic">then</span> wrap monad transformers around
    this monad to make bigger, better monads<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Concrete <span class="awesome">example</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> Suppose I was writing a server<span class="subdued">:</span>
      Each client handling thread <span class="highpriority">must</span> be of
      <span class="codekeywords">type</span> <span class="allcaps">IO</span> ()

      ThreadID).

    Monads are <span class="seleniumError">not composable</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This poses a <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span>, since composition is
    <span class="one">one</span> of the foremost patterns in functional
    programming<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    However, many alternatives have been
    devised<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="one">One</span> of the most common is the monad
    transformer<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Monad transformers <span class="safe">allow</span> developers to
    compose the effects of different monads,
    even <span class="logic">if</span> the monads themselves are <span class="seleniumError">not the</span>
    same<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    An <span class="awesome">example</span> is writing a do-statement that
    can<span class="subdued">:</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> <span class="textdiscard">abort</span> computation (<span class="logic">Except</span>T),
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> thread state (StateT), <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> connect to a database
      (<span class="kashyap">via</span> a Haskell library such as
      persistence <span class="logic">or</span> esqueleto).

    The transformers <span class="module">package</span> is used by over
    <span class="two">2</span>,<span class="zero">500</span> packages on Stackage<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">But</span> using monad transformers is a
    challenge <span class="codekeywords">for</span> many, even <span class="logic">if</span> they are

    How <span class="one">one</span> introduces a renaming <span class="codekeywords">for</span> an
    algebraic data <span class="codekeywords">type</span> into Haskell<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This is different from <span class="codekeywords">type</span> below, as <span class="toby">a</span>
    newtype requires a <span class="new">new constructor</span> as
    well<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    As an <span class="awesome">example</span>, when writing a compiler <span class="one">one</span>
    sometimes further qualifies Identifiers to

        newtype SimpleIdentifier = SimpleIdentifier Identifier
        newtype FunctionIdentifier = FunctionIdentifier Identifier

    Most often, <span class="one">one</span> supplies smart

    The syntax <span class="logic">and</span> usage of newtypes is
    virtually identical to that of data

    The converse <span class="failing">is not</span> <span class="safe">true</span>, however - data
    can only be replaced <span class="codekeywords">with</span> newtype <span class="logic">if</span> the

hiding
    When importing modules, without
    introducing a name into scope, entities
    can be excluded by using the form

        hiding (import<span class="one">1</span> , <span class="glue">...</span> , importn )

    which specifies that all entities exported
    by the named module should be imported
    <span class="codekeywords">except</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> those named in the list<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span><span class="subdued">:</span>

    The compiler sees that they begin <span class="codekeywords">with</span> a

    <span class="codekeywords">type</span> to fill that role<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Another way of putting this is that those
    variables are <span class="quote">'</span>universally quantified<span class="quote">'</span>.

imperative programming
    It is possible to write imperative-style
    code in Haskell as <span class="toby">well.</span>

    Sometimes we <span class="logic">really do</span> want to say
    something like <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>do A, <span class="logic">then</span> do B, <span class="logic">then</span> do
    C<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>.

    This adds a <span class="new">new dimension</span> to the simple

    notion of <span class="quote">'</span>happens before<span class="quote">'</span>.

    Haskell has embraced the Monad concept to
    describe computations that have an order
    of evaluation<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This turns out to be very handy because it
    can encapsulate effects such as <span class="toby">changing</span>

    Look at a single document at a time in the

    They <span class="criticalpriority">essential</span>ly take a single document

    to predict how relevant it is <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the
    current <span class="awesome">query</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The final ranking is achieved by simply
    sorting the result list by these document
    scores<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The score <span class="codekeywords">for</span> each document is independent
    of the other documents that are in the
    result list <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the <span class="awesome">query</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    All the standard <span class="failing">regression</span> <span class="logic">and</span>

attraction of Lisp in <span class="interesting">AI</span> research

    The original attraction of Lisp in <span class="interesting">AI</span>
    research was due to the fact that Lisp
    programs are lists (i.e., lists of
    instructions which can be treated like
    data) <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="googlered">so</span> Lisp programs can be written
    (<span class="kashyap">without</span> much fuss) that rewrite
    themselves (e.g., in response to
    <span class="unicode">“</span><span class="interesting">learning</span><span class="unicode">”</span>).

    Emacs Lisp is as <span class="safe">good</span> as <span class="safe">any other</span>
    implementation in that regard<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">And</span> the fact that John McCarthy (<span class="kashyap">the</span> guy
    who gave us Lisp) was, <span class="interesting">probably</span>, the first
    computer scientist to state the main
    <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span> of <span class="interesting">AI</span> (i.e., the Qualification
    <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span>) also helped Lisp<span class="unicode">’</span>s reputation as
    an <span class="interesting">AI</span> tool<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">But</span> <span class="interesting">AI</span> has moved far beyond the simple
    idea that a <span class="unicode">“</span>state of <span class="interesting">AI</span><span class="unicode">”</span> would be
    achieved when programs could rewrite
    themselves<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    What became obvious was that the real
    <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span> of <span class="interesting">AI</span> is in writing a program that
    knows what it <span class="highpriority">needs</span> to change about itself
    to improve itself (<span class="toby">and</span> <span class="googlered">so</span> the ability of a
    program to rewrite itself becomes
    secondary).

    <span class="logic">And</span>, practically, modern <span class="interesting">AI</span> research
    focuses on things (e.g., <span class="allcaps">ML</span>) that don<span class="unicode">’</span>t
    <span class="highpriority">require</span> Lisp<span class="unicode">’</span>s capabilities<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Each tree has a subset of the features<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="reallyBad">each each</span> trained on a different bootstrap

    Because bootstrapping involves sampling

    Consequently, the decision trees created

    Ensembling decision trees in <span class="highpriority">this way</span>

    Only a selection of the features is

spinal nerves
    Emerge from segments of the spinal cord<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

cranial nerves
    In contrast to spinal nerves<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The nerves that emerge directly from the
    brain (<span class="kashyap">including</span> the brainstem).

    Ten of the cranial nerves originate in the
    brainstem<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Cranial nerves relay information between
    the brain <span class="logic">and</span> parts of the body, primarily
    to <span class="logic">and</span> from regions of the head <span class="logic">and</span>
    neck<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Spinal nerves emerge sequentially from the
    spinal cord <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the spinal nerve closest
    to the head (<span class="one">C1</span>) emerging in the space
    above the first cervical vertebra<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The cranial nerves, however, emerge from
    the central nervous system above this
    level<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Each cranial nerve is paired <span class="logic">and</span> is
    present on both sides<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Depending on definition in humans there
    are twelve <span class="logic">or</span> thirteen cranial nerves
    pairs, which are assigned Roman numerals

    I<span class="unicode">–</span><span class="allcaps">XII</span>, sometimes also including cranial
    nerve <span class="zero">zero</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The numbering of the cranial nerves is
    based on the order in which they emerge
    from the brain, front to back (brainstem).

    The terminal nerves (<span class="zero">0</span>), olfactory nerves
    <span class="nine">(I)</span> <span class="logic">and</span> optic nerves (<span class="allcaps">II</span>) emerge from the
    cerebrum <span class="logic">or</span> forebrain, <span class="logic">and</span> the remaining
    ten pairs arise from the brainstem, which
    is the lower part of the brain<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The cranial nerves are considered
    components of the peripheral nervous
    system (<span class="allcaps">PNS</span>), although on a structural
    level the olfactory <span class="nine">(I)</span>, optic (<span class="allcaps">II</span>), <span class="logic">and</span>
    trigeminal (<span class="five">V</span>) nerves are more accurately
    considered part of the central nervous
    system (<span class="allcaps">CNS</span>).

plasticity rule
    When <span class="one">one</span> neuron drives the activity of
    another neuron, the connection between
    these neurons is potentiated<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="one">One</span> of the <span class="criticalpriority">essential</span> functions of natural

    We can know more than we can tell<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Human knowledge of how the world functions
    <span class="logic">and</span> capability are, to a large extent,
    beyond our <span class="codekeywords">explicit</span> understanding<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Explains the cognitive phenomenon that
    there exist many tasks which we, human
    beings, understand intuitively how to
    perform <span class="logic">but</span> <span class="seleniumError">cannot</span> verbalize the rules <span class="logic">or</span>
    <span class="seleniumError">procedures behind</span> it<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>self-ignorance<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> is common to many
    human activities, from driving a car in
    traffic to <span class="onlyhex">face</span> recognition<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Humans are relying on their tacit
    knowledge, which is difficult to
    adequately express by verbal means, when
    engaging these tasks<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Has been widely considered a major
    obstacle in the fields of <span class="interesting">AI</span> <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="automatic">automation</span>, since the absence of
    consciously accessible knowledge creates
    tremendous difficulty in programming<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Overcomed by recent advances in <span class="allcaps">ML</span>, some
    technological optimists argue<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="highpriority">Instead</span> of relaying on programmer<span class="unicode">’</span>s
    algorithms to instruct them in human
    knowledge, computer systems are now able
    to <span class="priority">learn</span> tacit rules from context,
    abundant data, <span class="logic">and</span> applied statistics <span class="serviceAdd">on</span>
    their own<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Since machines can infer the tacit
    knowledge that human beings draw upon from
    <span class="awesome">examples</span> without human assistance, they
    are <span class="seleniumError">no longer limited</span> by those rules

    The term was coined by Leonard Susskind
    around <span class="seven">1967</span> as a direct generalization of
    the world line concept <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a point
    particle in special <span class="logic">and</span> general

    The <span class="codekeywords">type</span> of string, the geometry of the

    presence of long-range <span class="five">background</span> fields
    (<span class="kashyap">such</span> as gauge fields) are encoded in a
    <span class="two">two</span>-dimensional conformal field theory
    defined on the worldsheet<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span>, the bosonic string in

    Meanwhile, a superstring worldsheet theory

    Since the value of this energy depends <span class="serviceAdd">on</span>

    A way of treating <span class="allcaps">RL</span> as an optimization
    <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Most traditional <span class="allcaps">RL</span> methods have <span class="seleniumError">no</span>
    convergence guarantees <span class="logic">and</span> there exist
    even divergence <span class="awesome">examples</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Solves<span class="subdued">:</span>
        Continuous states <span class="logic">and</span> actions in high
        dimensional spaces <span class="seleniumError">cannot</span> be treated
        by most <span class="serviceRemove">off</span>-the-shelf <span class="allcaps">RL</span> approaches<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Policy gradient methods do <span class="seleniumError">not suffer</span> from
    these problems in the same way<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span><span class="subdued">:</span>
        Uncertainty in the state might degrade
        the performance of the policy

        (<span class="toby">if</span> <span class="seleniumError">no additional state</span> estimator is
        being used)

        <span class="glue">...</span><span class="logic">but</span> the optimization techniques <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
        the policy do <span class="seleniumError">not need</span> to be changed<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> discrete

    The <span class="interesting">learning</span> performance is often
    increased<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Convergence at least to a local optimum is
    guaranteed<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The advantages of policy gradient methods
    <span class="codekeywords">for</span> real world applications are numerous<span class="morediscrete">.</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> policy representations can be chosen <span class="googlered">so</span>
      that it is meaningful <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the task <span class="logic">and</span>
      can incorporate domain knowledge
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> often fewer parameters are needed in the
      <span class="interesting">learning</span> process than in value-<span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span>
      based approaches
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> there is a variety of different
      algorithms <span class="codekeywords">for</span> policy gradient
      estimation in the literature which have
      a rather strong theoretical
      underpinning<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Additionally, policy gradient methods can
    be used either model-free <span class="logic">or</span> model-based
    as they are a generic formulation<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Of course, policy gradients are <span class="seleniumError">not the</span>
    salvation to all problems <span class="logic">but</span> also have
    significant problems<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    They are by definition on-policy (<span class="kashyap">note</span>
    that tricks like <span class="highpriority">importance</span> sampling can
    slightly alleviate this <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span>) <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="highpriority">need</span>
    to forget data very fast in order to avoid
    the introduction of a bias to the gradient
    estimator<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Hence, the use of sampled data <span class="failing">is not</span> very
    efficient<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In tabular representations, value <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span>
    methods are guaranteed to converge to a
    global maximum <span class="logic">while</span> policy gradients only
    converge to a local maximum <span class="logic">and</span> there <span class="five">may</span>
    be many maxima in discrete problems<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Policy gradient methods are often quite
    demanding to apply, mainly because <span class="one">one</span> has
    to have considerable knowledge about the
    system <span class="one">one</span> wants to control to make
    reasonable policy definitions<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Finally, policy gradient methods always
    have an <span class="safe">open</span> parameter, the <span class="interesting">learning</span> rate,
    which <span class="five">may</span> decide over the order of
    magnitude of the speed of convergence,
    these have led to <span class="new">new approaches</span> inspired
    by <span class="allcaps">EM</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>
