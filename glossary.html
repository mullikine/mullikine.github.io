Hausdorff dimension
fractal dimension

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> instance, the Hausdorff dimension of a

    Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing
    <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the usual sense of dimension, also
    known as the topological dimension<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    However, formulas have also been developed
    that <span class="safe">allow</span> calculation of the dimension of

    Because of the significant technical

    A linear approach to modeling the
    relationship between a scalar response <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="one">one</span> <span class="logic">or</span> more explanatory variables<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The relationships are modeled using linear
    <span class="interesting">predictor</span> functions whose <span class="sshError">unknown</span> model
    parameters are estimated from the data<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Such models are called linear models<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    linear <span class="failing">regression</span>

    Most commonly, the conditional mean of the
    response given the values of the
    explanatory variables (<span class="toby">or</span> <span class="interesting">predictors</span>) is
    assumed to be an affine <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> of those
    values<span class="discrete">;</span> less commonly, the conditional
    median <span class="logic">or</span> some other quantile is used<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">If</span> the goal is <span class="interesting">prediction</span>, <span class="logic">or</span> forecasting,
    <span class="logic">or</span> <span class="seleniumError">error</span> reduction, linear <span class="failing">regression</span> can
    be used to fit a <span class="interesting">predictive</span> model to an
    observed data set of values of the
    response <span class="logic">and</span> explanatory variables<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    After developing such a model, <span class="logic">if</span>
    additional values of the explanatory
    variables are collected without an
    accompanying response value, the fitted
    model can be used to make a <span class="interesting">prediction</span> of
    the response<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">If</span> the goal is to explain variation in the
    response <span class="variable">variable</span> that can be attributed
    to variation in the explanatory variables,
    linear <span class="failing">regression</span> analysis can be applied
    to quantify the strength of the
    relationship between the response <span class="logic">and</span> the
    explanatory variables, <span class="logic">and</span> in particular
    to determine whether some explanatory
    variables <span class="five">may</span> have <span class="seleniumError">no linear relationship</span>
    <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the response at all, <span class="logic">or</span> to identify
    which subsets of explanatory variables <span class="five">may</span>
    contain redundant information about the
    response<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Linear <span class="failing">regression</span> models are often fitted
    using the least squares approach, <span class="logic">but</span> they
    <span class="five">may</span> also be fitted in other ways, such as
    by minimizing the <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>lack of fit<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> in some
    other norm (<span class="kashyap">as</span> <span class="codekeywords">with</span> least absolute
    deviations <span class="failing">regression</span>), <span class="logic">or</span> by minimizing a
    penalized version of the least squares
    cost <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> as in ridge <span class="failing">regression</span>
    (<span class="allcaps">L</span><span class="two">2</span>-norm penalty) <span class="logic">and</span> lasso (<span class="allcaps">L</span><span class="one">1</span>-norm
    penalty).

    Conversely, the least squares approach can
    be used to fit models that are <span class="seleniumError">not linear</span>
    models<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Thus, although the terms <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>least squares<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>
    <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>linear model<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> are closely linked,
    they are <span class="seleniumError">not synonymous</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Skolem normal form
<span class="allcaps">SNF</span>
    Reduction to <span class="allcaps">SNF</span> is a method <span class="codekeywords">for</span> removing

    A formula of first-order <span class="logcode">logic</span> is in

first-order language

    each non-<span class="logcode">logical</span> symbol in that language,
    <span class="logic">and</span> determines a domain of discourse, D,
    that specifies the range of the
    quantifiers<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

domain of discourse
<span class="bullets">D</span>
    A nonempty set of <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>objects<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> of some kind<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

first-order formula
    A statement about the objects in a domain

homology
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>theory<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    A general way of associating a sequence of

cohomology
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span><span class="seleniumError">noun</span><span class="morediscrete">]</span>
    A sequence of abelian groups associated to

cochain complex
    Similar to a chain complex, <span class="codekeywords">except</span> that
    its homomorphisms follow a different
    convention<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The homology of a cochain complex is
    called its cohomology<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Suppose that you want to train a machine

    you call training data<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Now, the thing is that <span class="codekeywords">for</span> huge sets of
    training data you <span class="seleniumError">cannot</span> <span class="onlyhex">feed</span> the whole
    bunch to your model at once due to
    limitations in computer memory<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    So, what you do is break up your whole
    training data set into sizeable batches
    which can fit into your computer<span class="unicode">’</span>s memory
    at once<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    You <span class="logic">then</span> <span class="onlyhex">feed</span> these batches <span class="one">one</span> by <span class="one">one</span> to

    When all the batches are fed exactly once

    Basically it is equivalent to showing your

        Adding momentum helps solve that <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

<span class="codekeywords">NOTE</span><span class="subdued">:</span> High momentum should always be accompanied by low <span class="interesting">learning</span> rate, <span class="logic">else</span> you will overshoot the global optimum<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The carbon isotope records from both

    The lithologies <span class="logic">and</span> low organic-carbon

    In other words, the <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>autoregressive

    Explanation<span class="subdued">:</span>
        You have an innermost monad (<span class="kashyap">usually</span>

        You <span class="logic">then</span> wrap monad transformers

        better monads<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Similar to a regular monad, <span class="logic">but</span> it<span class="quote">'</span>s <span class="seleniumError">not a</span>

    Most of the monads in the mtl library have

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span>, the transformer equivalent of

    F-algebras generalize algebraic structure<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Rewriting the algebraic laws in terms of
    morphisms eliminates all references to
    quantified elements from the axioms, <span class="logic">and</span>
    these algebraic laws <span class="five">may</span> <span class="logic">then</span> be glued
    together in terms of a single functor F,
    the signature<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    F-algebras can also be used to represent
    data structures used in programming, such
    as lists <span class="logic">and</span> trees<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

catamorphism
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span><span class="ircroom">#category</span> theory<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    Deconstructs a data structure <span class="codekeywords">with</span> an
    F-<span class="math">algebra</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> its underlying functor<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A catamorphism <span class="codekeywords">for</span> some F-<span class="math">algebra</span> (<span class="one">X</span>,<span class="six">f)</span> is
    denoted (<span class="brightoperator3">|</span> <span class="six">f</span> <span class="brightoperator3">|</span>)F<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    When the functor F can be determined
    unambiguously, it is usually written (<span class="brightoperator3">|</span><span class="unicode">φ</span><span class="brightoperator3">|</span>)
    <span class="logic">or</span> cata <span class="unicode">φ</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Due to this choice of notation, a
    catamorphism is sometimes called a banana
    <span class="logic">and</span> the (<span class="brightoperator3">|</span>.<span class="brightoperator3">|</span>) notation is sometimes
    referred to as banana brackets<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The unique homomorphism from an initial

    In <span class="allcaps">FP</span>, catamorphisms provide
    generalizations of folds of lists to
    arbitrary algebraic data types, which can
    be described as initial algebras<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The dual concept is that of anamorphism
    that generalize unfolds<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A hylomorphism is the composition of an

    It<span class="quote">'</span>s really rather beautiful as a way to

    The general approach is that you <span class="seleniumError">don't</span>

    It has been shown, however, that using a

Regular expressions
    Describe regular languages in formal
    language theory<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    They have the same expressive power as
    regular grammars<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

regular language
rational language
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>formal language<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    Can be expressed using a regular
    expression, in the strict sense of the
    latter notion used in theoretical computer
    science (<span class="kashyap">as</span> opposed to many regular
    expressions engines provided by modern
    programming languages, which are augmented
    <span class="codekeywords">with</span> features that <span class="safe">allow</span> recognition of
    languages that <span class="seleniumError">cannot</span> be expressed by a
    classic regular expression).

    <span class="highpriority">Alternatively</span>, a regular language can be
    defined as a language recognized by a
    finite <span class="automatic">automaton</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The equivalence of regular expressions <span class="logic">and</span>
    finite <span class="automatic">automata</span> is known as <span class="ircname">Kleene's</span>

<span class="awesome">query</span> plan
<span class="awesome">query</span> execution plan
    An ordered set of steps used to access

    management system<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This is a specific <span class="logic">case</span> of the relational
    model concept of access plans<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Since <span class="allcaps">SQL</span> is declarative, there are
    typically a large number of alternative
    ways to execute a given <span class="awesome">query</span>, <span class="codekeywords">with</span> widely
    varying performance<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    When a <span class="awesome">query</span> is submitted to the database,

    different, correct possible plans <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
    executing the <span class="awesome">query</span> <span class="logic">and</span> returns what it
    considers the best option<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Because <span class="awesome">query</span> optimizers are imperfect,
    database users <span class="logic">and</span> administrators
    sometimes <span class="highpriority">need</span> to manually examine <span class="logic">and</span>
    tune the plans produced by the optimizer
    to get better performance<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Evaluate the linter<span class="quote">'</span>s performance<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    We want to have a linter that catches many
    <span class="seleniumError">errors</span>, <span class="logic">but</span> which takes <span class="seleniumError">false</span> alarms
    seriously<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Better to say nothing than to say the
    <span class="seleniumError">wrong</span> thing<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">And</span> the harm from saying the <span class="seleniumError">wrong</span> thing
    is greater than the benefit of having said
    the right thing<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Thus our score metric is defined as

        T (T / (F + T))<span class="gitbranch">^</span>k,

    <span class="codekeywords">where</span> T is the number of <span class="safe">true</span> positives
    (hits), F is the number of <span class="seleniumError">false</span> positives
    (<span class="kashyap">false</span> alarms), <span class="logic">and</span> k <span class="discrete">&gt;</span> <span class="zero">0</span> is a temperature
    parameter that determines the penalty <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
    imprecision<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In general, we choose as large a value of
    k as we can stomach, <span class="one">one</span> that strongly
    discourages the creation of rules that
    <span class="seleniumError">can't be</span> trusted<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Suppose that k = <span class="two">2</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">Then</span> <span class="logic">if</span> the linter detects <span class="zero">100</span> <span class="seleniumError">errors</span>, of

    The creative elements that are customary

Quantum Darwinism
    In the past, physicists tended to view the
    classical <span class="logic">and</span> quantum worlds as <span class="toby">being</span>
    divided by an abrupt barrier that makes a
    fundamental distinction between the
    familiar macroscopic (classical) <span class="logic">and</span> the
    unfamiliar microscopic (quantum) realms<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">But</span> in recent decades that view has
    changed<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Many experts now think that the transition
    is gradual, <span class="logic">and</span> that the definite
    classical states we measure come from
    <span class="interesting">probabilistic</span> quantum states progressively
    (<span class="kashyap">although</span> very quickly) losing their
    coherence as they become ever more
    entangled <span class="codekeywords">with</span> their environment<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Quantum Darwinism, put forward by Wojciech
    Zurek of Los Alamos National Laboratory in
    <span class="new">New Mexico</span>, argues that the classical
    states we perceive are robust quantum
    states that can survive entanglement
    during decoherence<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    His theoretical framework posits that the
    information about these states will be
    duplicated many times <span class="logic">and</span> disseminated
    throughout the environment<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Just as natural selection tells us that
    the <span class="tests">fittest</span> individuals in a species <span class="highpriority">must</span>
    survive to reproduce in great numbers <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="googlered">so</span> go on to shape evolution, the <span class="tests">fittest</span>
    quantum states will be copied <span class="logic">and</span> appear
    classical<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This redundancy means that many individual
    observers will measure <span class="safe">any given</span> state as
    having the same value, <span class="googlered">so</span> ensuring
    objective reality<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The last pair of laws is called

    Since absorption laws are unique to
    lattices, we discuss them here <span class="highpriority">instead</span> of
    in the glossary<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The absorption laws link a pair of
    semilattices in a kind of distributive
    relationship, <span class="googlered">so</span> that a lattice <span class="failing">is not</span>
    just <span class="safe">any two</span> semilattices that happen to
    be over the same set, <span class="logic">but</span> only
    semilattices that are linked in <span class="highpriority">this way</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In particular, the absorption laws ensure
    that the <span class="two">two</span> semilattices are dual of each
    other<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It can take a moment to see what it means,

    Positive integers form a lattice under the

particle horizon
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>cosmological horizon<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    The maximum distance from which light from
    particles could have traveled to the
    observer in the age of the universe<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It represents the boundary between the
    observable <span class="logic">and</span> the unobservable regions of
    the universe, <span class="googlered">so</span> its distance at the
    present epoch defines the size of the
    observable universe<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

hubble horizon
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>cosmological horizon<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    A conceptual horizon defining the boundary
    between particles that are moving slower
    <span class="logic">and</span> faster than the speed of light
    relative to an observer at <span class="one">one</span> given time<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="highpriority">Note</span> that this does <span class="seleniumError">not mean</span> the particle
    is unobservable, the light from the past
    is reaching <span class="logic">and</span> will <span class="safe">continue</span> to reach the
    observer <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a <span class="logic">while</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Also, more <span class="highpriority">important</span>ly, in the current
    expansion model e.g., light emitted from
    the Hubble radius will reach us in a
    finite amount of time<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It is a common misconception that light
    from the Hubble radius can never reach us<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It is <span class="safe">true</span> that particles on the Hubble
    radius recede from us <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the speed of
    light, <span class="logic">but</span> the Hubble radius gets larger
    over time (<span class="kashyap">because</span> the Hubble parameter H
    gets smaller over time), <span class="googlered">so</span> light emitted
    towards us from a particle on the Hubble
    radius will be inside the Hubble radius
    some time later<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Only light emitted from the cosmic event
    horizon <span class="logic">or</span> further will never reach us in
    a finite amount of time<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

event horizon
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>cosmological horizon<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    Differs from the particle horizon in that
    the particle horizon represents the
    largest comoving distance from which light
    could have reached the observer by a
    specific time, <span class="logic">while</span> the event horizon is
    the largest comoving distance from which
    light emitted now can ever reach the
    observer in the future<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

future horizon
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>cosmological horizon<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    In an accelerating universe, there are
    events which will be unobservable as <span class="toby">t</span>
    approaches <span class="unicode">∞</span> as signals from future events
    become redshifted to arbitrarily long
    wavelengths in the exponentially expanding
    de Sitter space<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This sets a limit on the farthest distance
    that we can possibly see as measured in
    units of proper distance today<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">Or</span>, more precisely, there are events that
    are spatially separated <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a certain
    frame of reference happening
    simultaneously <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the event occurring
    right now <span class="codekeywords">for</span> which <span class="seleniumError">no signal will</span> ever
    reach us, even though we can observe
    events that occurred at the same location
    in space that happened in the distant
    past<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">While</span> we will <span class="safe">continue</span> to receive signals
    from this location in space, even <span class="logic">if</span> we
    wait an infinite amount of time, a signal
    that left from that location today will
    never reach us<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Additionally, the signals coming from that
    location will have less <span class="logic">and</span> less energy
    <span class="logic">and</span> be less <span class="logic">and</span> less frequent until the
    location, <span class="codekeywords">for</span> all practical purposes,
    becomes unobservable<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In a universe that is dominated by dark
    energy which is undergoing an exponential
    expansion of the scale factor, all objects
    that are gravitationally unbound <span class="codekeywords">with</span>

        H-bonds reform <span class="logic">and</span> the cycle repeats<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Each cycle doubles the amount of <span class="allcaps">DNA</span>
    present in the sample<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Each step is conveniently triggered by

    Temperature regulation enables the

        The temperature is raised to
        approximately <span class="four">94</span><span class="unicode">°</span>F<span class="morediscrete">.</span> The heat breaks

        the <span class="allcaps">DNA</span> polymerase during extension<span class="morediscrete">.</span>
        The polymerase <span class="highpriority">must</span> have a segment of

        pairs <span class="logic">and</span> reforming <span class="logic">or</span> copying the

        only copy in <span class="one">one</span> direction along the

Fluid mosaic model
    Lipids move, proteins move<span class="morediscrete">.</span>
        See <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>Sendai virus<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>.

    The plasma membrane is described to be
    fluid because of its hydrophobic integral
    components such as lipids <span class="logic">and</span> membrane
    proteins that move laterally <span class="logic">or</span> sideways
    throughout the membrane<span class="morediscrete">.</span> That means the
    membrane <span class="failing">is not</span> solid, <span class="logic">but</span> more like a
    <span class="quote">'</span>fluid<span class="quote">'</span>.

    The membrane is depicted as mosaic because
    like a mosaic that is made up of many
    different parts the plasma membrane is
    composed of different kinds of
    macromolecules, such as integral proteins,
    peripheral proteins, glycoproteins,
    phospholipids, glycolipids, <span class="logic">and</span> in some
    cases cholesterol, lipoproteins<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    According to the model, the plasma
    membrane is a lipid bilayer (<span class="kashyap">interspersed</span>
    <span class="codekeywords">with</span> proteins). It is <span class="googlered">so</span> because of its
    phospholipid component that can fold in
    itself creating a double layer - <span class="logic">or</span>
    bilayer - when placed in a polar
    surrounding, like water<span class="morediscrete">.</span> This structural
    feature of the membrane is <span class="criticalpriority">essential</span> to

        melting temperature of the plasma
        membrane<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        When trans,
            A trans configuration means that
            the next <span class="two">two</span> hydrogen atoms are
            bound to opposite sides of the
            double bond<span class="morediscrete">.</span>  As a result, they do
            <span class="seleniumError">not cause</span> the chain to bend much,
            <span class="logic">and</span> their shape is similar to
            straight saturated fatty acids<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        When cis,
            The effect of this is that, in
            restricted environments, such as
            when fatty acids are part of a
            phospholipid in a lipid bilayer,
            <span class="logic">or</span> <span class="allcaps">TAG</span> in lipid droplets, cis
            bonds limit the ability of fatty
            acids to be closely packed, <span class="logic">and</span>

            temperature of the membrane <span class="logic">or</span> of
            the fat<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

            A cis configuration means that
            adjacent hydrogen atoms are on the
            same side of the double bond<span class="morediscrete">.</span> The
            rigidity of the double bond
            freezes its conformation <span class="logic">and</span>, in
            the <span class="logic">case</span> of the cis isomer, causes
            the chain to bend <span class="logic">and</span> restricts
            the conformational freedom of the
            fatty acid<span class="morediscrete">.</span> The more double bonds
            the chain has in the cis

intermediate representation

<span class="allcaps">SSA</span>
<span class="allcaps">SSA</span> form
static single assignment form
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>compiler design<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    A property of an <span class="allcaps">IR</span>, which requires that
    each <span class="variable">variable</span> is assigned exactly once,
    <span class="logic">and</span> every <span class="variable">variable</span> is defined before it is
    used<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Existing variables in the original <span class="allcaps">IR</span> are
    split into versions, <span class="new">new variables</span>
    typically indicated by the original name
    <span class="codekeywords">with</span> a subscript in textbooks, <span class="googlered">so</span> that
    every definition gets its own version<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In <span class="allcaps">SSA</span> form, use-<span class="codekeywords">def</span> chains are <span class="codekeywords">explicit</span>
    <span class="logic">and</span> each contains a single element<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="one">One</span> can expect to find <span class="allcaps">SSA</span> in a compiler
    <span class="codekeywords">for</span> Fortran <span class="logic">or</span> C, whereas in functional
    language compilers, such as those <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
    Scheme, <span class="allcaps">ML</span> <span class="logic">and</span> Haskell, <span class="allcaps">CPS</span> is generally
    used<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="allcaps">SSA</span> is formally equivalent to a
    well-behaved subset of <span class="allcaps">CPS</span> excluding
    non-local control flow, which does <span class="seleniumError">not</span>
    occur when <span class="allcaps">CPS</span> is used as <span class="toby">intermediate</span>
    representation<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    So optimizations <span class="logic">and</span> transformations
    formulated in terms of <span class="one">one</span> <span class="toppriority">immediately</span>
    apply to the other<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

<span class="emacstmuxkey">A-normal</span> form
<span class="allcaps">ANF</span>

<span class="allcaps">CPS</span>
Continuation-<span class="success">passing</span> style
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>fp<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    A style of programming in which control is
    <span class="success">passed</span> explicitly in the form of a
    continuation<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This is contrasted <span class="codekeywords">with</span> direct style,
    which is the usual style of programming<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> written in continuation-<span class="success">passing</span>
    style takes an extra argument<span class="subdued">:</span> an <span class="codekeywords">explicit</span>
    <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>continuation<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>, i.e<span class="morediscrete">.</span> a <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> of <span class="one">one</span>
    argument<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    When the <span class="allcaps">CPS</span> <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> has computed its
    result value, it <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>returns<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> it by calling
    the continuation <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> <span class="codekeywords">with</span> this value
    as the argument<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    That means that when invoking a <span class="allcaps">CPS</span>
    <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span>, the calling <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> is required
    to supply a procedure to be invoked <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
    the subroutine<span class="quote">'</span>s <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span><span class="safe">return</span><span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> value<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Expressing code in this form makes a
    number of things <span class="codekeywords">explicit</span> which are
    implicit in direct style<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    These <span class="codekeywords">include</span><span class="subdued">:</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> procedure returns, which become apparent
      as calls to a continuation<span class="discrete">;</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> intermediate values, which are all given

    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> order of argument evaluation, which is
      made <span class="codekeywords">explicit</span><span class="discrete">;</span> <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> tail calls, which simply call a
      procedure <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the same continuation,
      unmodified, that was <span class="success">passed</span> to the
      caller<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Programs can be <span class="automatic">automatically</span> transformed
    from direct style to <span class="allcaps">CPS</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Functional <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="logcode">logic</span> compilers often use
    <span class="allcaps">CPS</span> as an intermediate representation
    <span class="codekeywords">where</span> a compiler <span class="codekeywords">for</span> an imperative <span class="logic">or</span>
    procedural programming language would use
    static single assignment form (<span class="allcaps">SSA</span>).

    <span class="allcaps">SSA</span> is formally equivalent to a subset of
    <span class="allcaps">CPS</span> (<span class="kashyap">excluding</span> non-local control flow,
    which does <span class="seleniumError">not occur</span> when <span class="allcaps">CPS</span> is used as
    intermediate representation).

    Functional compilers can also use <span class="allcaps">ANF</span> (<span class="kashyap">but</span>

    (<span class="kashyap">described</span> in the <span class="awesome">examples</span> below) in <span class="allcaps">CPS</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="allcaps">CPS</span> is used more frequently by compilers

Software Transactional Memory
<span class="allcaps">STM</span>

    <span class="allcaps">STM</span> is a strategy implemented in software,

    A transaction in this context occurs when

skew heap

    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>heap<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

accuracy paradox
    The paradoxical finding that accuracy is

    when <span class="interesting">classifying</span> in <span class="interesting">predictive</span> analytics<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This is because a simple model <span class="five">may</span> have a
    high level of accuracy <span class="logic">but</span> be too crude to
    be useful<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span>, <span class="logic">if</span> the incidence of category
    A is dominant, being found in <span class="nine">99</span><span class="subdued">%</span> of
    cases, <span class="logic">then</span> <span class="interesting">predicting</span> that every <span class="logic">case</span> is
    category A will have an accuracy of <span class="nine">99</span><span class="subdued">%</span>.

    Precision <span class="logic">and</span> recall are better measures
    in such cases<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The underlying issue is that there is a
    <span class="codekeywords">class</span> imbalance between the positive <span class="codekeywords">class</span>
    <span class="logic">and</span> the negative <span class="codekeywords">class</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Precision <span class="logic">and</span> recall help, <span class="logic">but</span> precision
    too can be biased by very unbalanced <span class="codekeywords">class</span>
    priors in the <span class="tests">test</span> sets<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

information vs entropy
    Information quantifies how surprising an

    Entropy quantifies how much information

information gain

    Measures the reduction in entropy <span class="logic">or</span>
    surprise by splitting a dataset according

    The reduction in entropy <span class="logic">or</span> surprise by
    transforming a dataset <span class="logic">and</span> is often used
    in training decision trees<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A larger information gain suggests a lower

    hence less surprise<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The amount of information that<span class="quote">'</span>s gained by
    knowing the value of the attribute, which
    is the entropy of the distribution before

    The largest information gain is equivalent
    to the smallest entropy<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A form of regularization used to avoid

    an iterative method, such as <span class="toby">GD.</span>

    Such methods update the learner <span class="googlered">so</span> as <span class="toby">to</span>
    make it better fit the training data <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
    each iteration<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Up to a point, this improves the learner<span class="quote">'</span>s

    Past that point, however, improving the

    When in comes to <span class="allcaps">RNNs</span>, the tensors usually

    <span class="logic">If</span> the input is (batch_size, sequence_num,

    <span class="logic">If</span> the input is (sequence_num, batch_size,

    Depending on the network structure, it

    <span class="logic">And</span> depending on the previous layers, <span class="one">one</span>

    another might be required, either by the

    As far as I can <span class="highpriority">remember</span>, batch major is

Core Categorical Feature Concepts
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> Vocabulary
      The set of possible values <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a
      categorical feature<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

      It<span class="quote">'</span>s used to train the embeddings <span class="logic">or</span>
      create the hash buckets <span class="codekeywords">for</span> categorical
      features<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> Hash buckets
      The simplest way to map <span class="whiteonblack">categorical</span>
      features is just to hash their values,
      possibly into a set of buckets, whose
      number is determined <span class="logic">or</span> a hyperparameter<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> <span class="one">One</span> hot encoding
      Given a categorical input feature, <span class="logic">if</span> we
      simply map <span class="whiteonblack">the</span> possible values to
      numbers (<span class="kashyap">say</span> red-<span class="discrete">&gt;</span><span class="one">1</span>, <span class="blue">blue</span>-<span class="discrete">&gt;</span><span class="two">2</span>, green-<span class="discrete">&gt;</span><span class="three">3</span>)
      we are putting red <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="blue">blue</span> closer in
      meaning (<span class="two">2</span><span class="numberpunctuation">-</span><span class="one">1</span>=<span class="one">1</span>), even <span class="logic">if</span> they <span class="seleniumError">aren't any</span>

      (<span class="three">3</span><span class="numberpunctuation">-</span><span class="one">1</span>=<span class="two">2</span>).

      <span class="highpriority">Instead</span>, a <span class="one">one</span> hot encoding feature column
      would create <span class="three">3</span> separate nodes <span class="codekeywords">for</span> red,
      <span class="blue">blue</span>, <span class="logic">and</span> green, <span class="logic">and</span> have each <span class="one">one</span> <span class="codekeywords">except</span>
      the actual value be <span class="zero">0</span>, <span class="logic">and</span> the actual
      value <span class="one">1</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

      <span class="highpriority">This way</span> red is <span class="seleniumError">no closer to</span> <span class="blue">blue</span> than

    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> Softmax
      Like a sigmoid <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span>, <span class="logic">but</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> multiple

      values to a set of <span class="interesting">probabilities</span> that sum

      A very common pattern is <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the final

      training those vectors<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

      See the wor<span class="two">d2vec</span> tutorial here<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

      It provides more <span class="interesting">semantic</span>s than just a
      <span class="one">one</span>-hot encoding since similar input
      features will have more similar values<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

      <span class="highpriority">Instead</span> of a node <span class="codekeywords">for</span> every possible value
      of the category, you use <span class="textdone">a fixed</span> size
      <span class="codekeywords">vector</span> (depth).

      <span class="one">One</span> <span class="highpriority">interesting</span> side-effect of this

    Let<span class="unicode">’</span>s roll back a bit to understand the
    basic concept of Transformers<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Multi-Head Attention block<span class="morediscrete">.</span>
        We are now familiar <span class="codekeywords">with</span> <span class="allcaps">RNN</span><span class="unicode">’</span>s
        shortcoming is that it <span class="failing">is not</span> well
        versed in handling dependencies
        between input <span class="logic">or</span> output tokens
        themselves<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        <span class="codekeywords">To</span> handle this flaw, the Transformer
        just allows the encoder <span class="logic">and</span> decoder to
        see the entire input sequence all at
        once, directly modelling these
        dependencies using self-attention<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        This fundamental idea of transformer
        is implemented by its <span class="criticalpriority">vital</span> component,
        the Multi-Head Attention block<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    We say that the <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> that maps your

    The largest variation of a deep <span class="allcaps">NN</span> <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
    ReLU activation <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> arises when the
    layer <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the fewest nodes changes its
    activation pattern<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    An <span class="highpriority">important</span> implication is that deep <span class="allcaps">NN</span>
    is a useful tool to generate functions
    most of whose variations are concentrated
    on a smaller area of the input space near
    the boundaries corresponding to the layer
    <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the fewest nodes<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In turn, this property makes the <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span>
    more invariant to input transformation<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    That is, our theoretical result gives a

bias

    <span class="logic">If</span> the average <span class="interesting">predicted</span> values are far

        When a model has a high bias <span class="logic">then</span> it

variance
    Occurs when the model performs <span class="safe">good</span> on the

    Tells us how scattered are the <span class="interesting">predicted</span>

    High variance
        Causes overfitting that
        implies that the algorithm models random

        When a model has a high variance <span class="logic">then</span> the

    These measures are called hyperparameters,

    <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Hyperparameter optimization finds a tuple

Docker Machine
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span><span class="allcaps">VM</span><span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    A very small <span class="allcaps">VM</span> that runs an instance of

    It can be understood as a container of
    containers<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Docker host
    Docker Host is the machine that Docker
    Engine is installed<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Docker host is the machine <span class="codekeywords">where</span> you
    installed the docker engine<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The docker container can be compared <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
    a simple process <span class="success">running</span> on that same
    docker host<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Docker engine
    Supports the tasks <span class="logic">and</span> workflows involved
    to build, ship <span class="logic">and</span> run container-based
    applications<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The engine creates a server-side daemon

    processes, <span class="logic">but</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> calls).

    The program can <span class="logic">then</span> jump to the called
    subroutine<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Producing such code <span class="highpriority">instead</span> of a standard
    call sequence is called tail call
    elimination<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Tail call elimination

    allows procedure calls in tail position to
    be implemented as efficiently as <span class="toby">goto</span>
    statements, thus allowing efficient
    structured programming<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In the words of Guy L<span class="morediscrete">.</span> Steele, <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>in
    general, procedure calls <span class="five">may</span> be usefully
    thought of as <span class="allcaps">GOTO</span> statements which also
    <span class="codekeywords">pass</span> parameters, <span class="logic">and</span> can be uniformly
    coded as <span class="morediscrete">[</span>machine code<span class="morediscrete">]</span> <span class="allcaps">JUMP</span>
    instructions.<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>

    <span class="seleniumError">Not all</span> programming languages <span class="highpriority">require</span> tail
    call elimination<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    However, in functional programming
    languages, tail call elimination is often
    guaranteed by the language standard,
    allowing tail recursion to use a similar
    amount of memory as an equivalent loop<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The special <span class="logic">case</span> of tail recursive calls,
    when a <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> calls itself, <span class="five">may</span> be more
    amenable to call elimination than general
    tail calls<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    When the language <span class="interesting">semantic</span>s do <span class="seleniumError">not</span>
    explicitly support general tail calls, a
    compiler can often still optimize sibling
    calls, <span class="logic">or</span> tail calls to functions which
    take <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="safe">return</span> the same types as <span class="toby">the</span>

<span class="three">third</span>-generation programming language
<span class="three">3GL</span>
    A generational way to categorize
    high-level computer programming
    languages<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Examples<span class="subdued">:</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> C
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> C++
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> C#
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> Java
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> JavaScript

    Some advanced <span class="three">3GLs</span> like Python, Ruby, <span class="logic">and</span>
    Perl combine some <span class="four">4GL</span> abilities within a
    general-purpose <span class="three">3GL</span> environment<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Also, libraries <span class="codekeywords">with</span> <span class="four">4GL</span>-like features
    have been developed as add-ons <span class="codekeywords">for</span> most
    popular <span class="three">3GLs</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This has blurred the distinction of <span class="four">4GL</span>
    <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="three">3GL</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>


fourth-generation programming language
<span class="four">4GL</span>
    <span class="safe">Any computer</span> programming language that
    belongs to a <span class="codekeywords">class</span> of languages envisioned
    as an advancement upon <span class="three">3GLs</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Each of the programming language
    generations aims to provide a higher level
    of abstraction of the internal computer
    hardware details, making the language more
    programmer-friendly, powerful, <span class="logic">and</span>
    versatile<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">While</span> the definition of <span class="four">4GL</span> has changed
    over time, it can be typified by operating
    more <span class="codekeywords">with</span> large collections of information
    at once rather than focusing on just bits
    <span class="logic">and</span> bytes<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Languages claimed to be <span class="four">4GL</span> <span class="five">may</span> <span class="codekeywords">include</span>
    support <span class="codekeywords">for</span> database management, report
    generation, mathematical optimization, <span class="allcaps">GUI</span>
    development, <span class="logic">or</span> web development<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Some researchers state that <span class="four">4GLs</span> are a
    subset of domain-specific languages<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The concept of <span class="four">4GL</span> was developed from the
    <span class="zero">1970s</span> through the <span class="zero">1990s</span>, overlapping most
    of the development of <span class="three">3GL</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

fifth-generation programming language
<span class="five">5GL</span>
    <span class="safe">Any programming</span> language based on <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span>
    solving using constraints given to the
    program, rather than using an algorithm
    written by a programmer<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Most constraint-based <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="logcode">logic</span>
    programming languages <span class="logic">and</span> some other
    declarative languages are fifth-generation
    languages<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

attribute grammar
    A formal way to <span class="codekeywords">define</span> attributes <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the
    productions of a formal grammar,
    associating these attributes <span class="codekeywords">with</span> values<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The evaluation occurs in the nodes of the
    abstract syntax tree, when the language is
    processed by some parser <span class="logic">or</span> compiler<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The attributes are divided into <span class="two">two</span>
    groups<span class="subdued">:</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> synthesized attributes, <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> inherited attributes<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The synthesized attributes are the result
    of the attribute evaluation rules, <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="five">may</span>
    also use the values of the inherited
    attributes<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The inherited attributes are <span class="success">passed</span> down
    from parent nodes<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In some approaches, synthesized attributes
    are used to <span class="codekeywords">pass</span> <span class="interesting">semantic</span> information up
    the parse tree, <span class="logic">while</span> inherited attributes
    help <span class="codekeywords">pass</span> <span class="interesting">semantic</span> information down <span class="logic">and</span>
    across it<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> instance, when constructing a language
    translation tool, such as a compiler, it
    <span class="five">may</span> be used to assign <span class="interesting">semantic</span> values to
    syntax constructions<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Also, it is possible to validate <span class="interesting">semantic</span>
    checks associated <span class="codekeywords">with</span> a grammar,
    representing the rules of a language <span class="seleniumError">not</span>
    explicitly imparted by the syntax
    definition<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Attribute grammars can also be used to
    translate the syntax tree directly into
    code <span class="codekeywords">for</span> some specific machine, <span class="logic">or</span> into
    some intermediate language<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="one">One</span> strength of attribute grammars is that
    they can transport information from
    anywhere in the abstract syntax tree to
    anywhere <span class="logic">else</span>, in a controlled <span class="logic">and</span> formal
    way<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

context sensitive analysis
    A process in compiler construction,

    Type-<span class="one">1</span> grammars (Context-sensitive grammar)
        Generate context-sensitive languages<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        The languages described by these
        grammars are exactly all languages
        that can be recognized by a linear
        bounded <span class="automatic">automaton</span> (<span class="kashyap">a</span> nondeterministic

        These languages are exactly all
        languages that can be recognized by a

        syntax also includes context-sensitive
        name resolution due to declarations
        <span class="logic">and</span> scope<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        Often a subset of grammars is used to
        make parsing easier, such as by an <span class="allcaps">LL</span>
        parser<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Type-<span class="three">3</span> grammars (Regular grammar)
        Generate the regular languages<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        Such a grammar restricts its rules to
        a single nonterminal on the left-hand
        side <span class="logic">and</span> a right-hand side consisting
        of a single terminal, possibly
        followed by a single nonterminal
        (<span class="kashyap">right</span> regular).

        <span class="highpriority">Alternatively</span>, the right-hand side of
        the grammar can consist of a single
        terminal, possibly preceded by a
        single nonterminal (<span class="kashyap">left</span> regular).

        These generate the same languages<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        However, <span class="logic">if</span> left-regular rules <span class="logic">and</span>
        right-regular rules are combined, the
        language <span class="highpriority">need</span> <span class="seleniumError">no longer be</span> regular<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        These languages are exactly all
        languages that can be decided by a
        finite state <span class="automatic">automaton</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        Additionally, this family of formal
        languages can be obtained by regular
        expressions<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        Regular languages are commonly used to

Operational <span class="interesting">semantic</span>s
    A category of formal programming language
    <span class="interesting">semantic</span>s in which certain desired

poincare duality <span class="morediscrete">[</span>theorem<span class="morediscrete">]</span>
    A basic result on the structure of the

Adam
Adaptive Moment Estimation
   Another method that computes adaptive

   In addition to storing an exponentially
   decaying average of past squared gradients
   v<span class="codekeywords">_t</span> like Adadelta <span class="logic">and</span> RMSprop, Adam also
   keeps an exponentially decaying average of
   past gradients m<span class="codekeywords">_t</span>, similar to momentum<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

   Whereas momentum can be seen as a ball
   <span class="success">running</span> down a slope, Adam behaves like a
   heavy ball <span class="codekeywords">with</span> friction, which thus
   prefers flat minima in the <span class="seleniumError">error</span> surface<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

   We compute the decaying averages of past
   <span class="logic">and</span> past squared gradients m<span class="codekeywords">_t</span> <span class="logic">and</span> v<span class="codekeywords">_t</span>

    The relationships are modeled using linear

    Such models are called linear models<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    linear <span class="failing">regression</span>

    Most commonly, the conditional mean of the
    response given the values of the
    explanatory variables (<span class="toby">or</span> <span class="interesting">predictors</span>) is
    assumed to be an affine <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> of those
    values<span class="discrete">;</span> less commonly, the conditional
    median <span class="logic">or</span> some other quantile is used<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">If</span> the goal is <span class="interesting">prediction</span>, <span class="logic">or</span> forecasting,
    <span class="logic">or</span> <span class="seleniumError">error</span> reduction, linear <span class="failing">regression</span> can
    be used to fit a <span class="interesting">predictive</span> model to an
    observed data set of values of the
    response <span class="logic">and</span> explanatory variables<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    After developing such a model, <span class="logic">if</span>
    additional values of the explanatory
    variables are collected without an
    accompanying response value, the fitted
    model can be used to make a <span class="interesting">prediction</span> of
    the response<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">If</span> the goal is to explain variation in the
    response <span class="variable">variable</span> that can be attributed
    to variation in the explanatory variables,
    linear <span class="failing">regression</span> analysis can be applied
    to quantify the strength of the
    relationship between the response <span class="logic">and</span> the
    explanatory variables, <span class="logic">and</span> in particular
    to determine whether some explanatory
    variables <span class="five">may</span> have <span class="seleniumError">no linear relationship</span>
    <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the response at all, <span class="logic">or</span> to identify
    which subsets of explanatory variables <span class="five">may</span>
    contain redundant information about the
    response<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Linear <span class="failing">regression</span> models are often fitted
    using the least squares approach, <span class="logic">but</span> they
    <span class="five">may</span> also be fitted in other ways, such as
    by minimizing the <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>lack of fit<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> in some
    other norm (<span class="kashyap">as</span> <span class="codekeywords">with</span> least absolute
    deviations <span class="failing">regression</span>), <span class="logic">or</span> by minimizing a
    penalized version of the least squares
    cost <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> as in ridge <span class="failing">regression</span>
    (<span class="allcaps">L</span><span class="two">2</span>-norm penalty) <span class="logic">and</span> lasso (<span class="allcaps">L</span><span class="one">1</span>-norm
    penalty).

    Conversely, the least squares approach can
    be used to fit models that are <span class="seleniumError">not linear</span>
    models<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Thus, although the terms <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>least squares<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>
    <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>linear model<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> are closely linked,

    Suppose that you want to train a machine
    <span class="interesting">learning</span> model <span class="codekeywords">with</span> some data<span class="morediscrete">.</span> That data
    you call training data<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Now, the thing is that <span class="codekeywords">for</span> huge sets of
    training data you <span class="seleniumError">cannot</span> <span class="onlyhex">feed</span> the whole
    bunch to your model at once due to
    limitations in computer memory<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    So, what you do is break up your whole
    training data set into sizeable batches
    which can fit into your computer<span class="unicode">’</span>s memory
    at once<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    You <span class="logic">then</span> <span class="onlyhex">feed</span> these batches <span class="one">one</span> by <span class="one">one</span> to
    your model <span class="codekeywords">for</span> training<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    When all the batches are fed exactly once
    you <span class="textdone">complete</span> what is called an epoch<span class="morediscrete">.</span>
    Basically it is equivalent to showing your
    model the whole training data bunch once<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Now, you have to carry this <span class="one">one</span> multiple
    times <span class="codekeywords">for</span> <span class="success">successful</span> training, hence,

        Adding momentum helps solve that <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

<span class="codekeywords">NOTE</span><span class="subdued">:</span> High momentum should always be accompanied by low <span class="interesting">learning</span> rate, <span class="logic">else</span> you will overshoot the global optimum<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        There are more things which are arrows

    Monad

    Explanation<span class="subdued">:</span>
        You have an innermost monad (<span class="kashyap">usually</span>
        Identity <span class="logic">or</span> <span class="allcaps">IO</span> <span class="logic">but</span> you can use <span class="safe">any</span>
        monad).

        You <span class="logic">then</span> wrap monad transformers
        around this monad to make bigger,
        better monads<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Similar to a regular monad, <span class="logic">but</span> it<span class="quote">'</span>s <span class="seleniumError">not a</span>
    standalone entity<span class="subdued">:</span> <span class="highpriority">instead</span>, it modifies
    the behaviour of an underlying monad<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Most of the monads in the mtl library have
    transformer equivalents<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    By convention, the transformer version of
    a monad has the same name, <span class="codekeywords">with</span> a T stuck
    on the end<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span>, the transformer equivalent of
    State is StateT<span class="discrete">;</span> it adds mutable state to
    an underlying monad<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The WriterT monad transformer makes it
    possible to write data when stacked on top
    of another monad<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    F-algebras generalize algebraic structure<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Rewriting the algebraic laws in terms of
    morphisms eliminates all references to
    quantified elements from the axioms, <span class="logic">and</span>
    these algebraic laws <span class="five">may</span> <span class="logic">then</span> be glued
    together in terms of a single functor F,
    the signature<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    F-algebras can also be used to represent

catamorphism

    A catamorphism <span class="codekeywords">for</span> some F-<span class="math">algebra</span> (<span class="one">X</span>,<span class="six">f)</span> is
    denoted (<span class="brightoperator3">|</span> <span class="six">f</span> <span class="brightoperator3">|</span>)F<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    When the functor F can be determined

    <span class="logic">or</span> cata <span class="unicode">φ</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Due to this choice of notation, a
    catamorphism is sometimes called a banana
    <span class="logic">and</span> the (<span class="brightoperator3">|</span>.<span class="brightoperator3">|</span>) notation is sometimes

    In <span class="allcaps">FP</span>, catamorphisms provide
    generalizations of folds of lists to

    The dual concept is that of anamorphism

    Allows you to<span class="subdued">:</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> omit values from the tuple syntax,
      unifying the standard tuple sugar <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
      the tuple constructor syntax to form <span class="one">one</span>
      generalized syntax <span class="codekeywords">for</span> tuples<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Normally, tuples are constructed <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the
    standard tuple sugar, which looks like
    this<span class="subdued">:</span>

        (<span class="one">1</span>, <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>hello<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>, <span class="six">6</span><span class="numberpunctuation">.</span><span class="five">5</span>, Just (), <span class="morediscrete">[</span><span class="five">5</span>, <span class="five">5</span>, <span class="six">6</span>, <span class="seven">7</span><span class="morediscrete">]</span>)

    This could be considered shorthand <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the

    However, the <span class="codekeywords">explicit</span> tuple constructor
    (,,,,) could just as easily be considered
    section sugar <span class="codekeywords">for</span> tuples, expanding to<span class="subdued">:</span>

        <span class="morediscrete">\v</span> w <span class="one">x</span> <span class="two">y</span> <span class="three">z</span> -&gt; (v, w, <span class="one">x</span>, <span class="two">y</span>, <span class="three">z</span>)

    The coefficient estimates <span class="codekeywords">for</span> Ordinary

    When features are correlated <span class="logic">and</span> the

Quantum Darwinism
    In the past, physicists tended to view the
    classical <span class="logic">and</span> quantum worlds as <span class="toby">being</span>
    divided by an abrupt barrier that makes a
    fundamental distinction between the
    familiar macroscopic (classical) <span class="logic">and</span> the
    unfamiliar microscopic (quantum) realms<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">But</span> in recent decades that view has
    changed<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Many experts now think that the transition
    is gradual, <span class="logic">and</span> that the definite
    classical states we measure come from
    <span class="interesting">probabilistic</span> quantum states progressively
    (<span class="kashyap">although</span> very quickly) losing their
    coherence as they become ever more
    entangled <span class="codekeywords">with</span> their environment<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Quantum Darwinism, put forward by Wojciech
    Zurek of Los Alamos National Laboratory in
    <span class="new">New Mexico</span>, argues that the classical
    states we perceive are robust quantum
    states that can survive entanglement
    during decoherence<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    His theoretical framework posits that the
    information about these states will be
    duplicated many times <span class="logic">and</span> disseminated
    throughout the environment<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Just as natural selection tells us that
    the <span class="tests">fittest</span> individuals in a species <span class="highpriority">must</span>
    survive to reproduce in great numbers <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="googlered">so</span> go on to shape evolution, the <span class="tests">fittest</span>
    quantum states will be copied <span class="logic">and</span> appear
    classical<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This redundancy means that many individual
    observers will measure <span class="safe">any given</span> state as
    having the same value, <span class="googlered">so</span> ensuring
    objective reality<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A formal specification language<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It is used to design, model, document, <span class="logic">and</span>
    verify concurrent systems<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="allcaps">TLA</span>+ has been described as <span class="toby">exhaustively-</span>
    <span class="tests">testable</span> pseudocode, <span class="logic">and</span> its use likened

    systems<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Less a programming language <span class="logic">and</span> more a
    systems modeling language<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It<span class="quote">'</span>s like writing a mathematical proof <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
    your system <span class="codekeywords">where</span> you describe each action
    the system takes, the invariants to
    describe <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>correctness<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> of the system <span class="logic">and</span>
    its state, <span class="logic">and</span> the <span class="allcaps">TLA</span> checker runs some
    kind of analysis of every possible state
    described by your model <span class="logic">and</span> that the
    invariants still hold <span class="safe">true</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> all
    possible states<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It<span class="quote">'</span>s like <span class="success">running</span> a unit <span class="tests">test</span> in parallel
    <span class="codekeywords">where</span> all possible inputs are provided
    concurrently<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Allows you to encode your system as <span class="toby">a</span>
    state machine, <span class="codekeywords">define</span> invariants that <span class="highpriority">must</span>
    always be <span class="safe">true</span>, <span class="logic">and</span> the checker will
    explore your state machine <span class="logic">and</span> verify that
    the invariants are always <span class="safe">true</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    An <span class="awesome">example</span> would be encoding a distributed
    locking system, <span class="codekeywords">with</span> an invariant saying
    <span class="comment">&quot;</span><span class="seleniumError">no lock is</span> owned by more than <span class="one">1</span> node at a
    time<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>.

    You would encode all of the locking <span class="logic">and</span>
    unlocking behavior in your state machine,
    <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="logic">then</span> the checker would verify it<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Builds on the concepts of functional

    Where functional programming applies to
    lists of elements, functional reactive
    programming is applied to streams of
    elements<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The kinds of functions in functional
    programming, such as map, filter, <span class="logic">and</span>
    reduce all have analogues that can be
    applied to streams<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In addition, functional reactive
    programming includes functions to split
    streams, create pipelines of operations to
    transform the data within a stream, <span class="logic">and</span>
    merge streams<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Has been used <span class="codekeywords">for</span> programming <span class="allcaps">GUIs</span>,

Semiotics
semiotic studies
    The study of sign process (semiosis).

    It includes the study of signs <span class="logic">and</span> sign
    processes, indication, designation,
    likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy,
    metaphor, symbolism, signification, <span class="logic">and</span>
    communication<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It <span class="failing">is not</span> to be confused <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the
    Saussurean tradition called semiology,
    which is a subset of semiotics<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The semiotic tradition explores the study
    of signs <span class="logic">and</span> symbols as a significant part
    of communications<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Different from linguistics, semiotics also
    studies non-linguistic sign systems<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

monad transformer
    You have an innermost monad (<span class="kashyap">usually</span>
    Identity <span class="logic">or</span> <span class="allcaps">IO</span> <span class="logic">but</span> you can use <span class="safe">any monad</span>).

    You <span class="logic">then</span> wrap monad transformers around
    this monad to make bigger, better monads<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="texturl"><a href="https://">https://</a></span><span class="emacstmuxkey">page</span>.<span class="domainbright">mi</span>.<span class="domainbright">fu-berlin</span><span class="textpath">.de</span><span class="discrete">/</span>scravy<span class="discrete">/</span>realworldhaskell<span class="discrete">/</span>materialien<span class="discrete">/</span>monad-transformers-step-by-step<span class="textpath">.pdf</span>

    It is possible to create custom monads
    simply by composing the necessary monad
    transformers<span class="morediscrete">.</span> <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span>, <span class="logic">if</span> you <span class="highpriority">need</span> a
    monad <span class="codekeywords">with</span> state <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="seleniumError">error</span> handling, just
    take the StateT <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="seleniumError">Error</span>T monad
    transformers <span class="logic">and</span> combine them<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Concrete <span class="awesome">example</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> Suppose I was writing a server<span class="subdued">:</span>

    Monads are <span class="seleniumError">not composable</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This poses a <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span>, since composition is
    <span class="one">one</span> of the foremost patterns in functional
    programming<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    However, many alternatives have been
    devised<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="one">One</span> of the most common is the monad
    transformer<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Monad transformers <span class="safe">allow</span> developers to
    compose the effects of different monads,
    even <span class="logic">if</span> the monads themselves are <span class="seleniumError">not the</span>
    same<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    An <span class="awesome">example</span> is writing a do-statement that
    can<span class="subdued">:</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> <span class="textdiscard">abort</span> computation (<span class="logic">Except</span>T),
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> thread state (StateT), <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> connect to a database
      (<span class="kashyap">via</span> a Haskell library such as
      persistence <span class="logic">or</span> esqueleto).

    The transformers <span class="module">package</span> is used by over
    <span class="two">2</span>,<span class="zero">500</span> packages on Stackage<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">But</span> using monad transformers is a
    challenge <span class="codekeywords">for</span> many, even <span class="logic">if</span> they are
    <span class="warning">already</span> writing useful, effectful,

    The reason <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the square brackets is that

hiding
    When importing modules, without
    introducing a name into scope, entities
    can be excluded by using the form

        hiding (import<span class="one">1</span> , <span class="glue">...</span> , importn )

    which specifies that all entities exported
    by the named module should be imported
    <span class="codekeywords">except</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> those named in the list<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span><span class="subdued">:</span>

        <span class="codekeywords">import</span> Prelude hiding (lookup,filter,foldr,foldl,<span class="null">null</span>,map)

    A <span class="logic">and</span> b are <span class="codekeywords">type</span> variables<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        map <span class="subdued">::</span> (<span class="kashyap">a</span> -&gt; <span class="two">b)</span> -&gt; <span class="morediscrete">[</span>a<span class="morediscrete">]</span> -&gt; <span class="morediscrete">[</span>b<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    The compiler sees that they begin <span class="codekeywords">with</span> a
    lowercase letter <span class="logic">and</span> as such allows <span class="safe">any</span>
    <span class="codekeywords">type</span> to fill that role<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Another way of putting this is that those
    variables are <span class="quote">'</span>universally quantified<span class="quote">'</span>.

imperative programming
    It is possible to write imperative-style
    code in Haskell as <span class="toby">well.</span>

    Sometimes we <span class="logic">really do</span> want to say
    something like <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>do A, <span class="logic">then</span> do B, <span class="logic">then</span> do
    C<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>.

    This adds a <span class="new">new dimension</span> to the simple
    world of <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span> application<span class="subdued">:</span> we <span class="highpriority">need</span> a
    notion of <span class="quote">'</span>happens before<span class="quote">'</span>.

    Haskell has embraced the Monad concept to
    describe computations that have an order
    of evaluation<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This turns out to be very handy because it
    can encapsulate effects such as <span class="toby">changing</span>
    state<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This <span class="codekeywords">type</span> of feedback is defined as

    The main goal of this project is to
    provide simple <span class="logic">and</span> robust facilities <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
    loadbalancing <span class="logic">and</span> high-availability to
    Linux system <span class="logic">and</span> Linux based
    infrastructures<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Loadbalancing framework relies on well-
    known <span class="logic">and</span> widely used <span class="allcaps">IPVS</span> kernel module
    providing Layer<span class="four">4</span> loadbalancing<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Keepalived implements a set of checkers to
    dynamically <span class="logic">and</span> adaptively maintain <span class="logic">and</span>
    manage loadbalanced server pool according
    their health<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    On the other hand high-availability is
    achieved by <span class="allcaps">VRRP</span> protocol<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="allcaps">VRRP</span> is a fundamental brick <span class="codekeywords">for</span> router
    <span class="failing">failover</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In addition, Keepalived implements a set
    of hooks to the <span class="allcaps">VRRP</span> finite state machine
    providing low-level <span class="logic">and</span> high-speed
    protocol interactions<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In order to offer <span class="tests">fastest</span> network <span class="failing">failure</span>
    detection, Keepalived implements <span class="allcaps">BFD</span>
    protocol<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="allcaps">VRRP</span> state transition can take into
    account <span class="allcaps">BFD</span> hint to drive fast state
    transition<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Keepalived frameworks can be used
    independently <span class="logic">or</span> all together to provide

Helm Charts
    Helm uses a packaging format called

    A chart is a collection of files that
    describe a related set of k<span class="eight">8s</span> resources<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A single chart might be used to deploy
    something simple, like a memcached pod, <span class="logic">or</span>
    something complex, like a full web app
    stack <span class="codekeywords">with</span> <span class="allcaps">HTTP</span> servers, databases,

    Packages of pre-configured k<span class="eight">8s</span> resources<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A Helm chart describes how to manage a
    specific application on k<span class="eight">8s</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It consists of metadata that describes the
    application, plus the infrastructure
    needed to operate it in terms of the
    standard k<span class="eight">8s</span> primitives<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Each chart references <span class="one">one</span> <span class="logic">or</span> more
    (<span class="kashyap">typically</span> Docker-compatible) container
    images that contain the application code
    to be run<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> <span class="one">One</span> <span class="logic">or</span> more templates, which contains
      Kubernetes manifest files<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Despite the fact you can run application

    (kubectl), the easiest way to run
    workloads in k<span class="eight">8s</span> is using the ready-made

    Helm charts simply indicate to k<span class="eight">8s</span> how to

    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>design pattern<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    The sidecar concept in k<span class="eight">8s</span> is getting more

    In the container world, it<span class="quote">'</span>s a common
    principle that a container should address
    a single concern only, <span class="logic">but</span> do it well<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The sidecar pattern helps achieving this
    principle by decoupling the main business
    <span class="logcode">logic</span> from supplementary tasks that extend
    the original functionality<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In k<span class="eight">8s</span>, a pod is a group of <span class="one">one</span> <span class="logic">or</span> more
    containers <span class="codekeywords">with</span> shared storage <span class="logic">and</span>
    network<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A sidecar is a utility container in a pod
    that<span class="quote">'</span>s loosely coupled to the main
    application container<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Perhaps the most well known use <span class="logic">case</span> of
    sidecars is proxies in a service mesh
    architecture, <span class="logic">but</span> there are other
    <span class="awesome">examples</span>, including <span class="logcode">log</span> shippers,
    monitoring agents <span class="logic">or</span> data loaders<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Sidecars have been used <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a long time in
    k<span class="eight">8s</span>, <span class="logic">but</span> the pattern was <span class="seleniumError">not supported</span> as
    a built-in feature in k<span class="eight">8s</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It was only a nominal distinction, <span class="logic">and</span>
    sidecar containers were basically regular
    containers in a pod<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">But</span> the more applications <span class="started">started</span>
    embracing the pattern, the more issues
    have turned up<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Soon it became clear that k<span class="eight">8s</span> should

    people usually pay attention to is the
    untyped lambda calculus

typed lambda calculus
    A typed formalism that uses the lambda-
    symbol (<span class="unicode">λ</span>) to denote anonymous <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span>
    abstraction<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In this context, types are usually objects
    of a syntactic nature that are assigned to
    lambda terms<span class="discrete">;</span> the exact nature of a <span class="codekeywords">type</span>
    depends on the calculus considered (<span class="kashyap">see</span>
    kinds below).

Lambda Calculus
    Consists of constructing lambda terms <span class="logic">and</span>
    performing reduction operations on them<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It<span class="quote">'</span>s a simple notation <span class="codekeywords">with</span> <span class="three">3</span> parts<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="two">2</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span> way of building functions
    <span class="three">3</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span> way of applying functions

    .  is like whitespace
    <span class="unicode">λ</span>x means input <span class="one">x</span>

    <span class="unicode">λ</span>x.<span class="one">x</span>+<span class="one">1</span>

        Put a lambda, <span class="logic">then</span> an <span class="one">x</span> <span class="logic">then</span> a dot,
        <span class="logic">then</span> the output in terms of <span class="one">x</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        Either of these are ways to apply a

        Parentheses are used to disambiguate

        This is purely anecdotal, <span class="logic">but</span> in <span class="variable">my</span>

morphological typology
    A way of <span class="interesting">classifying</span> the languages of the
    world (<span class="kashyap">see</span> linguistic typology) that
    groups languages according to their common
    morphological structures<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The field organizes languages on the basis
    of how those languages form words by
    combining morphemes<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Analytic languages contain very little
    inflection, <span class="highpriority">instead</span> relying on features
    like word order <span class="logic">and</span> auxiliary words to
    convey meaning<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Synthetic languages, ones that are <span class="seleniumError">not</span>
    analytic, are divided into <span class="two">two</span> categories<span class="subdued">:</span>
    agglutinative <span class="logic">and</span> fusional languages

agglutination
    Words <span class="five">may</span> contain different morphemes to
    determine their meanings, <span class="logic">but</span> all of these
    morphemes (<span class="kashyap">including</span> stems <span class="logic">and</span> affixes)
    remain, in every aspect, unchanged after
    their unions<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

agglutinative language
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>synthetic language<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    Its morphology primarily uses
    agglutination<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    This results in generally more easily
    deducible word meanings <span class="logic">if</span> compared to
    fusional languages, which <span class="safe">allow</span>
    modifications in either <span class="logic">or</span> both the
    phonetics <span class="logic">or</span> spelling of <span class="one">one</span> <span class="logic">or</span> more
    morphemes within a word, usually
    shortening the word <span class="logic">or</span> providing easier
    pronunciation<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Agglutinative languages have generally <span class="one">one</span>
    grammatical category per affix <span class="logic">while</span>
    fusional languages have multiple<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The term was introduced by Wilhelm von
    Humboldt to <span class="interesting">classify</span> languages from a
    morphological point of view<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It is derived from the Latin verb
    agglutinare, which means <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>to glue
    together<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>.

fusional languages
    Non-agglutinative synthetic languages are
    fusional languages<span class="discrete">;</span> morphologically, they
    combine affixes by <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>squeezing<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> them
    together, drastically changing them in the
    process, <span class="logic">and</span> joining several meanings in a
    single affix (<span class="kashyap">for</span> <span class="awesome">example</span>, in the Spanish
    word com<span class="unicode">í</span> <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>I ate<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>, the suffix -<span class="unicode">í</span> carries
    the meanings of first person, singular
    number, past tense, perfective aspect,
    indicative mood, <span class="serviceAdd">active</span> voice.)

    The term agglutinative is sometimes
    incorrectly used as a synonym <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
    synthetic<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Used in <span class="highpriority">this way</span>, the term embraces both
    fusional languages <span class="logic">and</span> inflected
    languages.<span class="morediscrete">[</span>clarification needed<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    The agglutinative <span class="logic">and</span> fusional languages
    are <span class="two">two</span> <span class="closesyntax">ends</span> of a continuum, <span class="codekeywords">with</span> various
    languages falling more toward <span class="one">one</span> <span class="logic">or</span> the
    other end<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span>, Japanese is generally
    agglutinative, <span class="logic">but</span> displays fusion in
    ot<span class="unicode">ō</span>to (<span class="unicode">弟</span> younger brother), from oto+hito
    (<span class="kashyap">originally</span> woto+pito), <span class="logic">and</span> in its non-
    affixing verb conjugations<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A synthetic language <span class="five">may</span> use morphological
    agglutination combined <span class="codekeywords">with</span> partial usage
    of fusional features, <span class="codekeywords">for</span> <span class="awesome">example</span> in its
    <span class="logic">case</span> system (e.g., German, Dutch, <span class="logic">and</span>
    Persian).

    Agglutinative languages tend to have a
    high rate of affixes <span class="logic">or</span> morphemes per
    word, <span class="logic">and</span> to be very regular, in
    particular <span class="codekeywords">with</span> very few irregular verbs<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span>, Japanese has very few
    irregular verbs <span class="unicode">–</span>

    only <span class="two">two</span> are significantly irregular, <span class="logic">and</span>
    there are only about a dozen others <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
    only minor irregularity<span class="discrete">;</span> Ganda has only
    <span class="one">one</span> (<span class="toby">or</span> <span class="two">two</span>, depending on how <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>irregular<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>
    is defined)<span class="discrete">;</span> <span class="logic">while</span> in the Quechua
    languages, all the ordinary verbs are
    regular<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In Turkish, there is only <span class="one">one</span> irregular
    noun (su, meaning water), <span class="seleniumError">no irregular</span>
    verbs other than the copular verbs, <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="two">two</span> existential particles<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Korean has only ten irregular forms of
    conjugation <span class="codekeywords">except</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the <span class="success">passive</span> <span class="logic">and</span>
    causative conjugations<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Georgian is an <span class="logic">except</span>ion<span class="discrete">;</span> it is highly
    agglutinative (<span class="kashyap">with</span> up to <span class="eight">eight</span> morphemes
    per word), <span class="logic">but</span> it has a significant number
    of irregular verbs <span class="codekeywords">with</span> varying degrees of
    irregularity<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

anaphora

    An expression, <span class="logic">or</span> the use of an

morphology
    The study of words, how they are formed,

    It analyzes the structure of words <span class="logic">and</span>
    parts of words, such as stems, <span class="pathshell">root</span> words,
    prefixes, <span class="logic">and</span> suffixes<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Morphology also looks at parts of speech,

    context can change a word<span class="quote">'</span>s pronunciation
    <span class="logic">and</span> meaning<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Morphology differs from morphological

literary consonance
    <span class="texturl"><a href="https://">https://</a></span><span class="domainbright">en</span>.<span class="domainbright">wikipedia</span><span class="textpath">.org</span><span class="discrete">/</span>wiki<span class="discrete">/</span>Literary_consonance

    A stylistic literary device identified by
    the repetition of identical <span class="logic">or</span> similar
    consonants in neighbouring words whose
    vowel sounds are different (e.g<span class="morediscrete">.</span> coming
    home, hot foot).

    Consonance <span class="five">may</span> be regarded as <span class="toby">the</span>
    counterpart to the vowel-sound repetition
    known as <span class="ircname">assonance.</span>

    Alliteration is a special <span class="logic">case</span> of
    consonance <span class="codekeywords">where</span> the repeated consonant
    sound is at the stressed syllable, as <span class="toby">in</span>
    <span class="comment">&quot;</span>few flocked to the fight<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> <span class="logic">or</span> <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>around the
    rugged rock the ragged rascal ran<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>.

    Alliteration is usually distinguished from
    other types of consonance in poetic
    analysis, <span class="logic">and</span> has different uses <span class="logic">and</span>
    effects<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Another special <span class="logic">case</span> of consonance is
    sibilance, the use of several sibilant
    sounds such as <span class="discrete">/</span>s/ <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="discrete">/</span>sh/.

    An <span class="awesome">example</span> is the verse from Edgar Allan
    Poe<span class="quote">'</span>s <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>The Raven<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span><span class="subdued">:</span> <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span><span class="logic">And</span> the silken sad
    uncertain rustling of each purple
    curtain.<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>

    (This <span class="awesome">example</span> also contains assonance
    around the <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>ur<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> sound.)

    Another <span class="awesome">example</span> of consonance is the word
    <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>sibilance<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> itself<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

attraction of Lisp in <span class="interesting">AI</span> research
    <span class="texturl"><a href="https://">https://</a></span><span class="domain">www.</span><span class="domainbright">quora</span><span class="textpath">.com</span><span class="discrete">/</span>Would-Emacs-Lisp-be-<span class="emacstmuxkey">a-good-start-in-learning-A-I</span>

    The original attraction of Lisp in <span class="interesting">AI</span>
    research was due to the fact that Lisp
    programs are lists (i.e., lists of
    instructions which can be treated like
    data) <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="googlered">so</span> Lisp programs can be written
    (<span class="kashyap">without</span> much fuss) that rewrite
    themselves (e.g., in response to
    <span class="unicode">“</span><span class="interesting">learning</span><span class="unicode">”</span>).

    Emacs Lisp is as <span class="safe">good</span> as <span class="safe">any other</span>
    implementation in that regard<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">And</span> the fact that John McCarthy (<span class="kashyap">the</span> guy
    who gave us Lisp) was, <span class="interesting">probably</span>, the first
    computer scientist to state the main
    <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span> of <span class="interesting">AI</span> (i.e., the Qualification
    <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span>) also helped Lisp<span class="unicode">’</span>s reputation as
    an <span class="interesting">AI</span> tool<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">But</span> <span class="interesting">AI</span> has moved far beyond the simple
    idea that a <span class="unicode">“</span>state of <span class="interesting">AI</span><span class="unicode">”</span> would be
    achieved when programs could rewrite
    themselves<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    What became obvious was that the real
    <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span> of <span class="interesting">AI</span> is in writing a program that
    knows what it <span class="highpriority">needs</span> to change about itself
    to improve itself (<span class="toby">and</span> <span class="googlered">so</span> the ability of a
    program to rewrite itself becomes
    secondary).

    <span class="logic">And</span>, practically, modern <span class="interesting">AI</span> research
    focuses on things (e.g., <span class="allcaps">ML</span>) that don<span class="unicode">’</span>t
    <span class="highpriority">require</span> Lisp<span class="unicode">’</span>s capabilities<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Lisp is a fascinating language <span class="logic">but</span> it<span class="unicode">’</span>s
    <span class="seleniumError">not necessary</span> (<span class="logic">or</span>, in some ways,
    practical) <span class="codekeywords">for</span> <span class="interesting">AI</span> research (<span class="toby">and</span> I use it

Bagging

    <span class="morediscrete">[</span>ensemble <span class="emacstmuxkey">meta-algorithm</span><span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    Each tree has a subset of the features<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Involves creating multiple models of a
    single algorithm such as a decision tree,
    <span class="reallyBad">each each</span> trained on a different bootstrap
    sample of the data<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Because bootstrapping involves sampling
    <span class="codekeywords">with</span> replacement, some of the data in the
    sample is left out of each tree<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Consequently, the decision trees created
    are made using different samples which
    will solve the <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span> of overfitting to
    the sample size<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Ensembling decision trees in <span class="highpriority">this way</span>
    helps reduce the total <span class="seleniumError">error</span> because
    variance continues to decrease <span class="codekeywords">with</span> each
    <span class="new">new tree</span> <span class="onlyhex">added</span> without an increase in the
    bias of the ensemble<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    A bag of decision trees that uses subspace
    sampling is referred to as a random
    forest<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Only a selection of the features is
    considered at each node split which
    decorrelates the trees in the forest<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Another advantage of random forests is
    that they have an in-built validation
    mechanism<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Because only a percentage of the data is
    used <span class="codekeywords">for</span> each model, an out-of-bag <span class="seleniumError">error</span>
    of the model<span class="unicode">’</span>s performance can be

    The cranial nerves, however, emerge from

    nerve <span class="zero">zero</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The numbering of the cranial nerves is
    based on the order in which they emerge

    The terminal nerves (<span class="zero">0</span>), olfactory nerves
    <span class="nine">(I)</span> <span class="logic">and</span> optic nerves (<span class="allcaps">II</span>) emerge from the

    is the lower part of the brain<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The cranial nerves are considered

    level the olfactory <span class="nine">(I)</span>, optic (<span class="allcaps">II</span>), <span class="logic">and</span>

    that is language-independent <span class="logic">and</span>
    facilitates the application of machine
    <span class="interesting">learning</span> techniques<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The framework consists of a set of spatial
    roles based on the theory of holistic
    spatial <span class="interesting">semantic</span>s <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the intent of
    covering all aspects of spatial concepts,
    including both static <span class="logic">and</span> dynamic spatial

Polarity
    <span class="morediscrete">[</span><span class="ircroom">#sentiment</span> analysis<span class="morediscrete">]</span>

    Defines the phase of emotions expressed in

    <span class="asteriskoperator">*</span> Negative
    <span class="asteriskoperator">*</span> Very Negative

    On account of polarity the emotion <span class="logic">and</span>

    described<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span> a person has written a review

    would be <span class="shOptionNum">-</span><span class="zero">0</span><span class="numberpunctuation">.</span><span class="six">56</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It is clear from the values that it is a

    image of Hotel<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="highpriority">This way</span> polarity could easily determine

Grammatical analysis
grammatical parse
    The process of correlating the line
    sequence of lexemes (words) of the
    language <span class="codekeywords">with</span> its formal grammar<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The result of this is usually a parse tree
    <span class="logic">or</span> an abstract syntactical tree<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> grammatical parsing of computer
    languages context-free grammars are used<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Parsing
    Determine the parse tree (<span class="kashyap">grammatical</span>
    analysis) of a given sentence<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The grammar <span class="codekeywords">for</span> <span class="allcaps">NLs</span> is ambiguous <span class="logic">and</span>
    typical sentences have multiple possible
    analyses<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In fact, perhaps surprisingly, <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a
    typical sentence there <span class="five">may</span> be thousands of
    potential parses (<span class="kashyap">most</span> of which will seem
    completely nonsensical to a human).

    There are <span class="two">two</span> primary types of parsing,
    Dependency Parsing <span class="logic">and</span> Constituency
    Parsing<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Dependency Parsing focuses on the
    relationships between words in a sentence
    (<span class="kashyap">marking</span> things like Primary Objects <span class="logic">and</span>
    predicates), whereas Constituency Parsing
    focuses on building out the Parse Tree
    using a <span class="interesting">Probabilistic</span> Context-Free Grammar
    (<span class="allcaps">PCFG</span>).

Computational linguistics
    An interdisciplinary field concerned <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
    the statistical <span class="logic">or</span> rule-based modeling of
    <span class="allcaps">NL</span> from a computational perspective, as
    well as the study of appropriate
    computational approaches to linguistic
    questions<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Morphological segmentation
    Separate words into individual morphemes
    <span class="logic">and</span> identify the <span class="codekeywords">class</span> of the morphemes<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The difficulty of this task depends
    greatly on the complexity of the
    morphology (i.e<span class="morediscrete">.</span> the structure of words)
    of the language being considered<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    English has fairly simple morphology,
    especially inflectional morphology, <span class="logic">and</span>
    thus it is often possible to ignore this
    task entirely <span class="logic">and</span> simply model all
    possible forms of a word (e.g<span class="morediscrete">.</span> <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span><span class="safe">open</span>,
    opens, opened, opening<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>) as <span class="toby">separate</span>
    words<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In languages such as Turkish <span class="logic">or</span> Meitei, a
    highly agglutinated Indian language,
    however, such an approach <span class="failing">is not</span> possible,
    as each dictionary entry has thousands of

parsing
    <span class="logic">While</span> the goal is to emulate valid syntax,
    certain use-cases <span class="highpriority">require</span> supporting
    <span class="generalError">invalid syntax</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    There is a difference between parsing
    verses interpreting <span class="logic">or</span> compiling a
    language<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Your parse tree <span class="seleniumError">doesn't always</span> represent
    code that will run, <span class="logic">but</span> it has to be
    <span class="doublequote">&quot;</span>valid enough<span class="doublequote">&quot;</span> to represent readable code<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Example
        The Java language requires statements
        (<span class="kashyap">such</span> as the expression <span class="buildfiles">`</span><span class="one">x</span> = <span class="three">3</span><span class="buildfiles">`</span>) to be
        inside of methods<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        However, in the <span class="buildfiles">`</span>tree-sitter-java<span class="buildfiles">`</span>
        grammar, we explicitly <span class="safe">allow</span>
        statements to be parsed outside of
        methods<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        The grammar was loosened <span class="googlered">so</span> that
        syntax highlighting <span class="codekeywords">for</span> a code snippet
        of Java in a markdown file <span class="five">may</span> be
        supported<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        <span class="logic">While</span> this code <span class="seleniumError">wouldn't compile</span>, it
        <span class="seleniumError">doesn't break</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the use-cases that

    Back in <span class="six">1996</span>, a quantum physicist at Bell
    Labs in <span class="new">New Jersey</span> published a <span class="new">new recipe</span>
    <span class="codekeywords">for</span> searching through a database of <span class="seleniumError">N</span>
    entries<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Computer scientists have long known that
    this process takes around <span class="seleniumError">N</span> steps because
    in the worst <span class="logic">case</span>, the last item on the
    list could be the <span class="one">one</span> of interest<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    However, this physicist, Lov Grover,
    showed how the strange rules of quantum
    mechanics <span class="safe">allowed</span> the <span class="awesome">search</span> to <span class="textdone">be done</span> in
    a number of steps equal to the square <span class="pathshell">root</span>

    A way of treating <span class="allcaps">RL</span> as an optimization
    <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Most traditional <span class="allcaps">RL</span> methods have <span class="seleniumError">no</span>
    convergence guarantees <span class="logic">and</span> there exist
    even divergence <span class="awesome">examples</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Solves<span class="subdued">:</span>
        Continuous states <span class="logic">and</span> actions in high

    Policy gradient methods do <span class="seleniumError">not suffer</span> from
    these problems in the same way<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="awesome">example</span><span class="subdued">:</span>
        Uncertainty in the state might degrade
        the performance of the policy

        (<span class="toby">if</span> <span class="seleniumError">no additional state</span> estimator is
        being used)

        <span class="glue">...</span><span class="logic">but</span> the optimization techniques <span class="codekeywords">for</span>

    The <span class="interesting">learning</span> performance is often
    increased<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Convergence at least to a local optimum is
    guaranteed<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The advantages of policy gradient methods
    <span class="codekeywords">for</span> real world applications are numerous<span class="morediscrete">.</span>
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> policy representations can be chosen <span class="googlered">so</span>
      that it is meaningful <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the task <span class="logic">and</span>
      can incorporate domain knowledge
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> often fewer parameters are needed in the
      <span class="interesting">learning</span> process than in value-<span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span>
      based approaches
    <span class="diffRemove">-</span> there is a variety of different
      algorithms <span class="codekeywords">for</span> policy gradient
      estimation in the literature which have
      a rather strong theoretical
      underpinning<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Additionally, policy gradient methods can
    be used either model-free <span class="logic">or</span> model-based
    as they are a generic formulation<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Of course, policy gradients are <span class="seleniumError">not the</span>
    salvation to all problems <span class="logic">but</span> also have
    significant problems<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    They are by definition on-policy (<span class="kashyap">note</span>
    that tricks like <span class="highpriority">importance</span> sampling can
    slightly alleviate this <span class="gitRtcError">problem</span>) <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="highpriority">need</span>
    to forget data very fast in order to avoid
    the introduction of a bias to the gradient
    estimator<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Hence, the use of sampled data <span class="failing">is not</span> very
    efficient<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In tabular representations, value <span class="gitRtcPackage">function</span>
    methods are guaranteed to converge to a
    global maximum <span class="logic">while</span> policy gradients only
    converge to a local maximum <span class="logic">and</span> there <span class="five">may</span>
    be many maxima in discrete problems<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Policy gradient methods are often quite
    demanding to apply, mainly because <span class="one">one</span> has
    to have considerable knowledge about the
    system <span class="one">one</span> wants to control to make
    reasonable policy definitions<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Finally, policy gradient methods always
    have an <span class="safe">open</span> parameter, the <span class="interesting">learning</span> rate,
    which <span class="five">may</span> decide over the order of
    magnitude of the speed of convergence,
    these have led to <span class="new">new approaches</span> inspired

catkin
    The official build system of <span class="allcaps">ROS</span> <span class="logic">and</span> the
    <span class="success">successor</span> to the original <span class="allcaps">ROS</span> build
    system, rosbuild<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    catkin combines CMake macros <span class="logic">and</span> Python

    scripts to provide some functionality <span class="serviceAdd">on</span>
    top of CMake<span class="quote">'</span>s normal workflow<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    catkin was designed to be more
    conventional than rosbuild, allowing <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
    better distribution of packages, better
    cross-compiling support, <span class="logic">and</span> better
    <span class="warning2">portability</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    catkin<span class="quote">'</span>s workflow is very similar to
    CMake<span class="quote">'</span>s <span class="logic">but</span> adds support <span class="codekeywords">for</span> <span class="automatic">automatic</span>
    <span class="quote">'</span>find <span class="module">package</span><span class="quote">'</span> infrastructure <span class="logic">and</span> building
    multiple, dependent projects at the same
    time<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="warning2">Portability</span>
        <span class="one">One</span> of the biggest problems <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
        rosbuild is that it <span class="failing">is not</span> <span class="morediscrete">[</span>easily<span class="morediscrete">]</span>
        portable to all operating systems,
        especially Microsoft Windows<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        This is because rosbuild utilizes a
        mixture of Bash scripts, <span class="allcaps">GNU</span> <span class="priority">Make</span>, <span class="logic">and</span>
        CMake to build code<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        In rosbuild, when we invoke the build
        system, we have to call custom scripts
        provided <span class="codekeywords">with</span> rosbuild such as
        rosmake<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        rosmake is a Bash script that calls
        make which itself calls CMake which
        generates yet another makefile <span class="logic">and</span>
        <span class="codekeywords">finally</span> invoking make again!

        Catkin is much more elegant <span class="logic">and</span> is
        invoked by simply invoking CMake<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        Catkin is implemented as custom CMake
        macros along <span class="codekeywords">with</span> some Python code<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        As CMake <span class="logic">and</span> Python are portable,
        catkin is easily portable to <span class="safe">any</span>
        system that supports both Python <span class="logic">and</span>
        CMake<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        In fact, catkin projects can be used
        seamlessly <span class="codekeywords">with</span> other CMake projects
        <span class="Special">--</span> when catkin projects are built they
        also generate export information that
        allows them to be found <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the CMake

catkin
    The official build system of <span class="allcaps">ROS</span> <span class="logic">and</span> the
    <span class="success">successor</span> to the original <span class="allcaps">ROS</span> build
    system, rosbuild<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    catkin combines CMake macros <span class="logic">and</span> Python

    scripts to provide some functionality <span class="serviceAdd">on</span>
    top of CMake<span class="quote">'</span>s normal workflow<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    catkin was designed to be more
    conventional than rosbuild, allowing <span class="codekeywords">for</span>
    better distribution of packages, better
    cross-compiling support, <span class="logic">and</span> better
    <span class="warning2">portability</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    catkin<span class="quote">'</span>s workflow is very similar to
    CMake<span class="quote">'</span>s <span class="logic">but</span> adds support <span class="codekeywords">for</span> <span class="automatic">automatic</span>
    <span class="quote">'</span>find <span class="module">package</span><span class="quote">'</span> infrastructure <span class="logic">and</span> building
    multiple, dependent projects at the same
    time<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="warning2">Portability</span>
        <span class="one">One</span> of the biggest problems <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
        rosbuild is that it <span class="failing">is not</span> <span class="morediscrete">[</span>easily<span class="morediscrete">]</span>
        portable to all operating systems,
        especially Microsoft Windows<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        This is because rosbuild utilizes a
        mixture of Bash scripts, <span class="allcaps">GNU</span> <span class="priority">Make</span>, <span class="logic">and</span>
        CMake to build code<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        In rosbuild, when we invoke the build
        system, we have to call custom scripts
        provided <span class="codekeywords">with</span> rosbuild such as
        rosmake<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        rosmake is a Bash script that calls
        make which itself calls CMake which
        generates yet another makefile <span class="logic">and</span>
        <span class="codekeywords">finally</span> invoking make again!

        Catkin is much more elegant <span class="logic">and</span> is
        invoked by simply invoking CMake<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        Catkin is implemented as custom CMake
        macros along <span class="codekeywords">with</span> some Python code<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        As CMake <span class="logic">and</span> Python are portable,
        catkin is easily portable to <span class="safe">any</span>
        system that supports both Python <span class="logic">and</span>
        CMake<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

        In fact, catkin projects can be used
        seamlessly <span class="codekeywords">with</span> other CMake projects
        <span class="Special">--</span> when catkin projects are built they
        also generate export information that

computational graph
    Makes the framework be able to handle the
    lazy evaluation paradigm (<span class="toby">not</span> eager
    execution, which is implemented
    <span class="unicode">“</span>traditional<span class="unicode">”</span> imperative Python
    programming) is the computational graph
    =<span class="tensorflow">tf</span>.Graph=.

    Basically, this approach allows the
    programmer to create =<span class="tensorflow">tf</span>.Tensor= (edges)
    <span class="logic">and</span> =<span class="tensorflow">tf</span>.Operation= (nodes), which are <span class="seleniumError">not</span>
    evaluated <span class="toppriority">immediately</span>, <span class="logic">but</span> only when the
    graph is executed<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Such a method to constructing <span class="allcaps">ML</span> models is
    quite common <span class="codekeywords">for</span> many frameworks (<span class="kashyap">for</span>
    instance, a similar idea is used in Apache
    Spark) <span class="logic">and</span> has different pros <span class="logic">and</span> cons,
    which become obvious during writing <span class="logic">and</span>
    <span class="success">running</span> the code<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The main <span class="logic">and</span> <span class="highpriority">most important</span> advantage is
    the fact that dataflow graphs enable
    parallelism <span class="logic">and</span> distributed execution
    quite easily without explicitly
    usingmultiprocessing module<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In practice, well-written <span class="tensorflow">TF</span> model uses
    the resources of all of the cores as <span class="toby">soon</span>
    as it is launched without <span class="safe">any additional</span>
    configuration<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    However, a very obvious disadvantage of
    this workflow is that as long as <span class="toby">you’re</span>
    constructing your graph <span class="logic">but</span> <span class="seleniumError">not running</span> it
    <span class="codekeywords">with</span> (<span class="toby">or</span> without) some input provided, you
    can<span class="unicode">’</span>t ever be sure that it will <span class="seleniumError">not crash</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It definitely <span class="five">may</span> crash<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Also, unless you<span class="unicode">’</span>ve executed the graph,
    you can<span class="unicode">’</span>t estimate the <span class="success">running</span> time of it
    too<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The main components of the computational
    graph worth talking about are graph
    collections <span class="logic">and</span> graph structure<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Strictly speaking, the graph structure is
    the specific set of nodes <span class="logic">and</span> edges
    discussed earlier, <span class="logic">and</span> graph collections
    are sets of variables, which can be
    grouped <span class="logcode">logically</span><span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> instance, the common way to retrieve
    trainable variables of the graph is
    <span class="tensorflow">tf</span>.get_collection
    (<span class="tensorflow">tf</span>.GraphKeys.<span class="allcaps">TRAINABLE</span>_<span class="allcaps">VARIABLES</span>).

session
    Highly correlated <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the computational
    graph<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Has a bit more complex interpretation<span class="subdued">:</span> <span class="tensorflow">TF</span>
    session =<span class="tensorflow">tf</span>.Session= is used to connect
    between the client program <span class="logic">and</span> C++ runtime
    (<span class="kashyap">as</span> you <span class="highpriority">remember</span>, <span class="tensorflow">TF</span> is written in C++).

    Why C++<span class="brightoperator2">?</span>

    The answer is that mathematical operations
    implemented via this language can be very
    well optimized <span class="logic">and</span>, as the result, the
    computational graph operations can be
    processed <span class="codekeywords">with</span> a great performance<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="logic">If</span> you<span class="unicode">’</span>re using low-level <span class="tensorflow">TF</span> <span class="api">API</span> (<span class="kashyap">which</span>
    most of Python developers use), <span class="tensorflow">TF</span> session
    is invoked as a context manager<span class="subdued">:</span> <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
    =<span class="tensorflow">tf</span>.Session()= as sess<span class="subdued">:</span> syntax is used<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    The session <span class="codekeywords">with</span> <span class="seleniumError">no arguments passed</span> to
    the constructor (<span class="kashyap">as</span> in the previous
    <span class="awesome">example</span>) is using only the resources of
    the local machine <span class="logic">and</span> default <span class="tensorflow">TF</span> graph,
    <span class="logic">but</span> it can also access remote devices via
    distributed <span class="tensorflow">TF</span> runtime<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In practice, a graph can<span class="unicode">’</span>t exist without a
    session (<span class="kashyap">without</span> session it can<span class="unicode">’</span>t be
    executed) <span class="logic">and</span> the session always has a
    pointer to the global graph<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Diving deeper into the details of <span class="success">running</span>
    the session, the main point worth noticing
    is the syntax of it<span class="subdued">:</span> =<span class="tensorflow">tf</span>.Session.run()=.

    It can have as argument fetch (<span class="toby">or</span> list of
    fetches) which can be tensor, operation <span class="logic">or</span>
    tensor-like object<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    In addition, <span class="onlyhex">feed</span>_dict can be <span class="success">passed</span> (<span class="kashyap">this</span>
    optional argument is a mapping
    (dictionary) of <span class="tensorflow">tf</span>.placeholder objects to

Workspace
    In Terraform <span class="allcaps">CLI</span>, a workspace is an

    multiple workspaces lets you manage
    multiple non-overlapping sets of

    In Terraform Cloud, a workspace is a

Traceability matrix
software <span class="tests">testing</span> traceability matrix
    A document that traces <span class="logic">and</span> maps the

    specifications <span class="logic">and</span> another <span class="one">one</span> <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the

    A document that corelates <span class="safe">any two-baseline</span>
    documents that <span class="highpriority">require</span> a many-to-many
    relationship to check the completeness of
    the relationship<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    It is used to track the requirements <span class="logic">and</span>
    to check the current project requirements
    are met<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

Static Analysis
    Typically the source <span class="logic">or</span> object code of an
    application is analyzed directly (<span class="kashyap">without</span>
    executing it).

    Depending on the tools that are used, the
    resulting analysis can be fairly advanced
    (<span class="kashyap">especially</span> when formal methods can be
    used to prove certain properties of the
    code), <span class="logic">but</span> typically only a subset of the
    code can be analyzed completely
    statically<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    <span class="codekeywords">For</span> code sections that <span class="seleniumError">cannot</span> be analyzed
    statically, a conservative approach to
    <span class="interesting">classify</span> the severity of potential hazards
    can lead to many <span class="seleniumError">false</span> positives<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Static analysis tools can <span class="codekeywords">for</span> <span class="awesome">example</span> be
    used to ensure that code adheres to
    certain standards, e.g<span class="morediscrete">.</span> defined by the
    motor industry software reliability
    association (<span class="allcaps">MISRA</span>).

Dynamic Analysis
    An application <span class="highpriority">must</span> be executed in a way
    that represents the scenario that is of
    interest (e.g<span class="morediscrete">.</span> by providing corresponding
    inputs).

    As a result, the results that are acquired
    are <span class="seleniumError">not necessarily</span> representative <span class="codekeywords">for</span> the
    application <span class="logic">but</span> can be highly correlated
    to the selected scenario of interest<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Deriving (formal) guarantees based <span class="serviceAdd">on</span>
    dynamic analysis is typically difficult<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

    Nevertheless, dynamic analysis can provide
    a <span class="safe">good</span> understanding of the execution
    behavior of an application <span class="logic">and</span> is
    frequently used e.g<span class="morediscrete">.</span> in performance
    optimization<span class="morediscrete">.</span>

<span class="allcaps">PC</span>-lint
pclint

    <span class="allcaps">PC</span>-lint can be integrated into <span class="allcaps">IDEs</span> as <span class="toby">an</span>
    external tool, <span class="logic">and</span> the format of the
